[]			Okay, this again started that
[0:00:18.5]  Um first I oppose the project of one
[]			 So is probably is a global project
[0:00:26.6]  I said related it to your term project Visible projects
[]			 Many young proposal on the description off what we're gonna do before your term project
[0:00:35.1]  I see some of your quarterly started a discussion, which is kind of followed on very nicely
[0:00:49.3]  So, really, you can always modify this project because, uh, the way software development is really easily table in an incremental so probably at it in the off
[0:00:54.3]  And as you're doing your devoted commander, you're probably change your some of the ideas and the ideas
[0:01:04.7]  Um ah Niu are ideas this all fine? It's all part of the cave with the butt of a mentor, but another less
[]			 This is sure to be a starting point off your term project
[]			 So I suggest your team working together, which is some of you I really have done very nicely
[]			 It's kind of the template for what your proposal will be like on this issue
[]			 Nice toe
[0:01:35.6]  0 27 Sorry to 27 over there on the Friday two weeks from now, almost on Friday at 11 for tonight so that it will give me some time to do reading your submission over weekend
[0:01:43.9]  So you said, You know, this is a project that it means that you two group over your wrongness about neither one so mission and then out of Grover student, you have the same point Unless I said for molasses last across
[0:01:55.5]  We have this appear evaluation, if you have
[0:01:59.2]  Ah, um, disagreement among the team members say, Hey, I come to be so much more than the other student and nobody Somebody is really not a very responsive well, so that in Medicaid is probably that of Steven
[0:02:11.5]  We'll have a license point, then stood in the whole country Beauty more
[0:02:19.5]  But otherwise everybody will have the same grateful that a group project because it's really you know, nobody is the perfect ring anything
[]			 Everything on the we are, we are all calling in something
[0:02:34.9]  So if you're really in architect is I you're going use cases you're calling your manager The pieces modeling which we couldn't talk about negative next class is all fine
[0:02:42.1]  If you're really in the pilot on you, like into doing the medication, so is that nobody's perfect So we all working together to make it a project successful, be a successful
[]			 So that's the whole purpose
[]			 So I really want to see a viral particle
[0:02:54.8]  The collaborative will a team worker right here
[]			 So this is the template
[]			 Okay
[]			 Uh, seven meter long time
[]			 Identify a person who is responsible for the master file
[0:03:10.6]  You know, if you have any changes, immigration's all you need greater over there
[]			 And so one person is really responsible for this mission because sometimes that you're thinking about a he gonna do this a measure I think about the nobody really doing it
[0:03:23.7]  So you need a dedicated somebody who's really responsible
[0:03:29.2]  And so you said you this is the tabulator
[0:03:31.9]  Um, this is not a job
[0:03:34.1]  It's just now that everything you can't Ida the new things according to your own project part, this is just the my suggestions of what the You're the proposal
[0:03:46.7]  Should we include them? So this is documented is read The first Milestone York Terminal project and this class were this term
[]			 Oh, we our theme
[0:03:54.1]  Our FEMA is kind of smart
[]			 A home
[0:03:59.2]  We use the cheeky about the war since everything's that I was smart home
[0:04:05.0]  So using this as a theme, you can name your own project, whichever you where you want it is it
[]			 Open your imagination, just a tool
[]			 Just do any feature you'll propose, but you need to come together
[0:04:15.7]  Agree young settle features on the set of a theme off your turn, your group project
[0:04:21.8]  So as another's within the bigger umbrella off with Samara home
[]			 I'm fine with it
[0:04:26.4]  I received a student, Um, a murder we can ask me to about there
[]			 The project ideas
[0:04:44.3]  Would they do that? A group of particular doing summer for a, uh maybe the visually impaired people to help them how to navigate
[0:04:46.5]  Maybe the home, maybe Navigator
[0:04:52.2]  Anything they are, get in the home may be alerted to the office
[0:04:54.9]  The coast is a head off them, and it's just so wonderful
[0:04:58.2]  Proud of the ideas are really love it so much because what we are no
[0:05:05.0]  One would be valuable website
[0:05:08.5]  A particularly there one I spoke to call the accessibility a sensibility is to make the website is accessible toe Oh, people, I'll be We include the visually impaired hearing impaired, all those people so you cannot just have a super offense
[0:05:27.6]  A lot of flesh on your website is thing is so cool, but the visually impaired people just cannot see it on the color plunder people
[0:05:30.1]  So this project ideas this girl, which is it's so wonderful
[]			 Just just great
[0:05:36.6]  So this just the example how you're prodded it can do on the open your mind is you spend your it just open your imagination
[0:05:48.2]  What do you can do with the order? The speech of conversation on your other wars and services we have, which we're gonna get the angel that either the cement you're going along
[0:05:55.5]  So anyway, as long as the only pig amber that small homes and so is the, uh the sky's the limit
[0:06:02.5]  So what? I'd like to have it just really just the guidelines
[]			 Okay
[0:06:08.2]  You don't have a folder that were bait him like a word of my award, but just be the roughly skyline
[]			 This is a graduate class
[0:06:16.9]  I really I don't s so much focus on you to the lighters
[0:06:20.7]  So gradual student are much more surer than the undergrad students
[0:06:27.2]  So for a section I like, do you have ah executive summary which is a very short description off
[0:06:33.9]  What are the final? Probably going to do You know this This is for visually impaired people to help them in navigating in the house owes for a help the elderly people to have a better quality of life
[0:06:44.9]  So what problems about on it was the kid of energies, of the novelty of your project
[0:06:53.7]  So? So why this so important? So essentially this part is talking about why people want to paint it into your project
[]			 I know why you want to spend like a wake
[]			 So for your life or working on this project, why it is so meaningful
[0:07:04.4]  Ah, now who are the audience of your project? Who gonna use your project? Is it? No
[0:07:10.7]  What's the market? You savages? So I'm not like you to give a party tonight, Mom, A problem for your project, in the sense that it what do we call that? A calling is something so that you can reference to you know, you call a thio of maybe the names we can say I come I probably caught a rainbow
[]			 Okay, you can reference it
[0:07:33.4]  OK, that is Rambo's
[]			 So as the name of reference is always nice
[]			 So I like it
[]			 This is a private summary
[0:07:42.2]  Should be readable in a general term
[0:07:52.6]  That's now the four computer scientist so that the people we use to think about it these, eh, a general marketing the description so that people would understand it and they really can promote your project
[0:08:02.2]  So when the people see that is the old this is just a wonderful, fantastic A project
[]			 I really like to be part of that
[]			 So that's the purpose of the executive summary
[0:08:10.1]  It's normally the executive summary by the one page
[0:08:12.8]  So then you should have a competitive analysis
[]			 In a sense, an idea
[]			 What are the things that are out there? Why you want to do this, it project it Not just because you're professor ask you to you
[0:08:26.4]  This is something out there on the yours and probably better or more comprehensive or may be easy to use
[0:08:30.4]  We talk about a sovereign Jinyan term
[]			 We talk about it
[]			 Some of these color quality attributes remember the malfunction requirements
[0:08:40.3]  Why are so better, easy to use and maybe more a sense it ate well and maybe a, um, say easy to use it all
[0:08:47.9]  Just that whatever is that you think is a biter that would have out there on the river high level
[0:08:54.2]  Okay, just the the introduced some owner features that you think is really attracting
[0:09:00.0]  And then the things that making your proudest more meaningful and s o this is just the compact of analysis
[0:09:05.9]  And at least in some of the products out there in the compare your future were versus of their future
[0:09:12.0]  So just the game with the overview
[0:09:14.7]  This is also how do you contact the research? You know, you are graduate student, her master phD
[]			 You cannot do a research
[0:09:21.9]  Why do research? You need to have a broader literature searching to know what's out there in the market was out there, you know, research field
[0:09:28.4]  So you don't have the repeated what people have done
[]			 Another thing is the card they have
[]			 Every nation is kind of a very important in the sense that when often we have it is a company scientist
[0:09:41.2]  Uh, captain, Go people
[0:09:43.3]  We take these things therefore grand changing
[0:09:46.4]  So when we me somewhat the colonel's we talked about Okay, this is the self The colonel on This is a This software is the way we talk about these
[0:09:54.9]  What do we invite these? The argus eyes, the maybe access control
[]			 What is it? What do you mean by that? So we know what you mean
[0:10:06.5]  But ordinary people, they don't have idea what you mean
[0:10:13.2]  And also another way that why talk about a colonel? You've talked about a context
[]			 You talk about some things in common features
[0:10:16.8]  Access, control
[]			 I have my A definition off that
[]			 But my understanding may not be the same as the word your must
[0:10:23.5]  Any is
[0:10:27.8]  If I say access control, you have your idea would have access Pontoise
[]			 But I probably means something else
[]			 So they have a nation
[0:10:34.8]  This is really, you know, having a pre sauces divination
[0:10:37.4]  What do you mean? Your contacts
[0:10:39.8]  That when you use that a particular technical term So off course it is
[]			 It could be many
[]			 Could be You could just like a 50 or 100 terms
[]			 But I wanted something
[]			 The main term
[]			 Your project
[]			 You use your reference off often on
[]			 Then Could it be? You have a unique definition
[0:10:58.0]  Your project So have on the sea that so, um that is the had an invitation
[]			 So import enough today is it should be a very high level on a very unity level
[0:11:12.4]  And it isn't be consistent across your all your definite documentation that you won your reference The same thing you always do the same term across a reference
[]			 So did have definitions of very important
[0:11:23.2]  Think about days as your glossary
[0:11:24.5]  Offer your description
[]			 So this is essentially what it is
[]			 And then I like to have a over real scenarios use cases
[]			 So where you describe your product? Er, I want to know that even I am the user
[0:11:40.7]  You found the customer
[]			 I want to know what's the like
[0:11:43.1]  Holder scenarios
[0:11:45.5]  I'm gonna use your part actor how I'm gonna use that
[0:11:53.9]  So we do have a, uh uh this section you wanted tow the scrappy of her daughter from the user's perspective
[0:11:59.5]  So how are you gonna use user? How do I have with conversation with your compensation part? How do I contract with? Tell me once that my forelock information And while you have this hour in the radiant light is on
[0:12:11.5]  What did I use that for? Green Lighter, right? Delighted rule I do
[]			 What? Do what do I use that A four
[]			 So give me scenarios
[0:12:18.7]  In this case, the simple tax form It is okay
[0:12:21.2]  And actually even preferable, Because again, remember, when you talk about a requirement, that definition on a requirement specification, right? Listen more on the requirement of the definition
[0:12:37.0]  Parts that have user have a imagination, and then thinking about it, I convert you to reality
[]			 I would have this product
[0:12:41.1]  This is this How I can do a navigator among these
[]			 Give me some, uh, alert
[]			 Give me some, uh, suggestions on Give me some of conversation by making me happy, So Oh, this
[]			 How do I use that? So, you really want how? The story about who on how this happen, It's going to be used and, you know, it's a case
[]			 We really want to know what this is
[0:13:04.9]  Um er well, jewel, not how to save him
[]			 I do it Well
[]			 You see how this isn't? Do it
[]			 It is
[0:13:12.4]  Really? How about the architect titties on? Okay, so this is really what I just don't want to know What? And even in scenarios I composed of some of their own
[0:13:24.2]  How do you write a scenarios in a professional way? Um, have you a post that is so you can kind of follow that
[0:13:29.4]  How do we write of the scenarios? It's really just seven cities
[0:13:30.5]  It's just a simple sentences
[0:13:33.6]  So hopefully you can be squire
[0:13:34.1]  But the major scenarios off the functionality off your project
[0:13:40.2]  So give me a viral go the concrete of you off your project
[0:13:49.2]  So meaning that if I'm a venture capital, I'm gonna give ice the mind of my money into your parted and out if you want to make your product more attractive So and also keeping in mind the the purpose of the use of cases is a for future divine woman
[0:14:02.2]  So even for each of us, the cases that you need a havoc responding, the development goes with it
[0:14:15.3]  I know you have a one actual people talking about How do you write use cases? So most of all the like under it, most people talk about use cases, you know, just a very shallow way
[0:14:20.4]  So but I want to talk about how the use cases being used in the industry and from my experience, and so that we're gonna write a viral code, use cases in two days, so that it would be Ah, hopefully lecture of you
[]			 We covered next lecture also
[0:14:32.1]  So you can cuff initiate this assignment in two weeks, Okay? No
[]			 Now we talk about it
[]			 That requirements
[]			 We have a functional requirements
[0:14:41.7]  We have known function requirements
[]			 So now you learn that in lecture
[0:14:46.3]  You should use that in your pappa trees
[]			 So this is what I'm talking about right here
[]			 I like to have a initial least of a high level functional requirements
[0:14:55.3]  Okay, function increments
[0:14:56.4]  So you answer that question
[]			 You know what is a functional requirements? It's now that does the water function
[0:15:03.7]  The system we're gonna prove produce the airport
[0:15:13.7]  And that's now that the only thing and even understand that What is a malfunction? Requirements? OK, honest, then those talk concept the very, very solidly that you can't describe what is functional requirements
[0:15:22.2]  So I wanted youto have some high level functions requirements that you plenty developer and the price of your knowledge? That is the point
[0:15:26.7]  Of course, we can refine into achieve, which is modification later
[]			 That's all
[]			 Good by this point, would have a function So we want to get up
[0:15:37.9]  So focus on what? And now the how? Because you see Fung Ship train and keep the user in mind at this point
[0:15:45.9]  So why don't you develop these functions to be consistent with the audio's cases under other requirements about we talk about other scenarios
[]			 Okay, so scenarios give you what he had the picture
[0:16:04.8]  Was he gonna have a lot of the feet? Hell, functional requirements? Um, you have a more east enshi ation off with the beautiful pictures
[0:16:09.2]  So this is about from users perspective
[0:16:13.8]  You wantto remember each of requirement and use those numbers consistently
[0:16:14.7]  From now on
[]			 Say, hey, this hour a requirement
[0:16:18.2]  Heil our criminal number one on at one point you 1
[]			3 men 0
[0:16:23.9] 5 in the seat held the live shows on this song
[]			 For each of functionality, use the A's some lines to describe what that particular function A's
[0:16:39.0]  So when you write these function at it taking you so you should think about it that the violent person press packet iwill Hey, you tease, Elector, we can talk about how do we do with the conversation over the same statement? So if you're sensible too big that it is
[0:16:47.4]  If I have used many minutes indicated to describe this, the functionality that he means is too big to develop
[0:17:02.3]  You want to make on the simple succinct Does a simple one just one function and phone function on Lee? So the square 90 maybe no more than what you're firelines description
[]			 I love to see that off course, and your system is the super good
[0:17:08.5]  Super nice, easy to use
[0:17:10.5]  These two men came on, and that is your lung function requirements
[]			 I want to know that
[0:17:16.4]  What's your consideration? Off your the system of the project you will develop from a performance of perspective from a use abilities
[0:17:24.0]  Perspective focuses ability
[]			 So the global was talking about
[]			 I want to review too much a secret over there
[]			 A secret bother
[0:17:32.6]  They divided
[0:17:36.5]  But it's the system for the the the blind, the hearing impaired people, the visually impaired people that's easy to access
[0:17:47.8]  Right? So there's a wonderful idea, and it was expected that your security feature is the storage of the penetrator was the fault of covering
[0:18:01.8]  Okay, just remember some of one possible trying to qualify those calling the attributes because we said that I to your court of the attributes of must be able tool verifiable
[0:18:03.4]  To verify light, you need to quantify them
[0:18:07.6]  Okay, Mean, see? Oh, this isn't the most wrong faster
[0:18:13.3]  And I said, I always see that it wouldn't mean by foster the BMW a term a five minute second, even though the faster you novel
[0:18:21.5]  But if you want to get a one but it *** waiting on the colorful also your form within five seconds, you'll think it's a fast So trying thio quantify your those according attributes
[]			 No way
[0:18:31.9]  So, Frank, let me in terms of how the people gonna use your season market
[0:18:40.2]  My system is very easy to learn now that from getting familiar with my systems with my boss with my conversation bother no more than 30 minutes to training before at out early people
[0:18:49.8]  Okay, those would be the usability part, right? So you think I needed, like, a two days and seven hours before the outer let you use your power, But that isn't all good
[0:19:03.3]  So they said, uh, I'm not gonna help because they get a frustrated at work quickly
[0:19:07.7]  So and then, indeed, how? You're a system architecture
[0:19:13.3]  So why would help? What? Assistant marketer, you know, Think about what is it? Definition offices, the architecture? We'll have my lecture on that
[0:19:18.7]  So since the MCA teacher you need identify how many components to do
[]			 You're high on that
[]			 They are relationships
[0:19:27.4]  So this could be the tools of the prolonged wages software
[0:19:29.2]  The hardware used the wasn't seven cents, which is service is the user
[0:19:34.2]  Where'd you get a habit of the cold air you're gonna borrow? You can borrow, by the way, but you need to cry
[0:19:40.0]  Quite it
[]			 Those of the thing
[0:19:46.5]  So where was the component on the Howard of my conversation about communicated to the user and how usual
[0:19:48.9]  Real react
[]			 So anyway, so this is really identify the components, you know, system
[0:19:56.1]  You need identify the revision shaper among those components
[0:19:59.3]  So this is your system Architecture at Dover High level Announcer Joe
[0:20:03.5]  Team A
[]			 I like that
[]			 You you have Ah, your team names and we try
[0:20:09.6]  We'll talk about a schoolmaster Perata owner and the usual Rosa for you
[0:20:14.0]  Remember our next next election? I hope we can cover today as I mean
[0:20:20.3]  Talk about the strong practices which is even goto the industrial right now
[0:20:23.2]  Seems like everybody is talking about a squirm
[]			 So you need that you have a four a student
[0:20:31.7]  You one group in there Identify who? The schoolmaster who is a perfect donor
[0:20:34.2]  And who is that? A deal of developers
[0:20:35.5]  Off course Loser roads can change a person
[0:20:40.1]  We just spring to wear our but that initially so people should have their roles in your team and the reason of the heroes
[0:20:52.5]  Meaning so normally the schoolmaster Well, say to be responsible for lay out all the functionalities, make sure all the team working well together, making sure everybody's you responsable on
[0:21:08.4]  Then we can just work in Candidate will have a beautiful A project that we were on to make sure it is single, Uh, a project that enforcing the centimeter online You will
[0:21:14.0]  He failed your whole team of you fail the whole ship
[0:21:15.8]  We would think to the ocean
[]			 I said, That's a very important
[0:21:23.6]  So I want to have your in the initial who's the road and give me idea about your role playing your your team
[0:21:28.5]  So I don't like to see that so some of the tech, Elise
[]			 And just for your own reference, enough for my track references
[]			 You
[0:21:33.5]  So I disappoint you
[]			 I wanted you
[]			 Just think about your team
[0:21:38.7]  Say your mark
[0:21:39.6]  Everything's a tongue or is on track
[]			 Meaning it will be done on time
[0:21:45.1]  Under Maybe no easy was perceived
[]			 And all over some easy
[]			 Oh, so that he was You have a problem, is it? But it wouldn't be fine
[]			 The problems just later
[0:21:54.2]  So I want a U team decide on the basically means off a communication
[0:21:56.7]  Maybe use a select, you know
[0:21:58.6]  And he used a trial
[]			 Oh, to try your scram
[0:22:00.6]  A practice
[0:22:04.2]  And what a time slot to meet Outside across
[]			 Do you have a regular meeting about your project? Say everyone
[0:22:09.2]  Daddy
[0:22:09.8]  Ammonia
[0:22:11.9]  What we meet on that we meet twice a week Or how the way meet So on
[0:22:16.0]  Excuse off
[0:22:18.2]  Two members that defined and unknown to all I see what you're good at
[]			 What I'm good
[0:22:22.4]  That would depart
[0:22:24.2]  I can contribute which Carver you can contribute
[0:22:27.5]  And a team we insure that all member is it really the final product? One? Because because the value of a meter each
[0:22:33.9]  Uncle Bobby was with me
[]			 The one version
[0:22:37.3]  And if you see any spending a rose over there, something doesn't make any sense
[0:22:41.1]  Why radiator? Then Jose responses
[0:22:47.4]  So everybody read that on understand Needed before sublimation
[]			 OK, this is important
[0:22:55.6]  So just that this is just the really, uh, my wages and making sure that you'll have a cohesive Well, you know, very coherent working relationship together
[]			 It's not really so much off
[0:23:03.4]  I'm being micromanaged
[]			 I don't know
[]			 So serve a mission and I won't have a problem
[0:23:09.2]  Tight hole
[0:23:13.2]  You know that you're a project a name we to project documenting you're talking about
[0:23:18.0]  So this is always a quart of have case, Okay? Every community, some
[0:23:22.6]  I mean, you need to know At least maybe two years later, you forgot about which crosses that
[0:23:27.3]  Which project isn't that so? Have I ever detailed document? Okay
[0:23:33.4]  And that was your goal, remember? Remember, he has probably that Okay, we're over number 13
[0:23:36.3]  And that was in the student and the emails
[0:23:37.8]  A team on a widget date
[]			 You deal with that
[0:23:39.9]  And that was the riveting his cheese
[0:23:42.9]  So he is a first draft second Andraka Russia were one point
[]			 Well, which at one point you so it was a feedback
[]			 Okay
[0:23:54.3]  They suggested we will give summer because more professional you some of greeting criteria on just that
[0:23:57.4]  I just a brick of these A dunk, you know, just like Lisa
[]			 And just the give you ideas
[0:24:05.1]  How? The way we're gonna evaluate, get butter
[]			 You don't have to just have some more reasonable approach, you know, just a reasonable right
[0:24:14.3]  So wait away handed
[]			 We have rules that we help
[0:24:16.6]  Wallace is unwell handed
[0:24:18.3]  We need it'll be reasonable
[0:24:21.3]  So and just the just the guy like you before For those who do not follow the rules, you will follow the rules and then we can No, even you're gonna break it
[]			 Was the same
[0:24:32.7]  Even Wanna break the rules? You master first and mastered rules, right? I like it when you play music at the beginning, you are always details scales on And why you're so good You don't have to follow the scale anymore just in her life
[0:24:47.6]  So any questions about the homework Pro Day one food is clear
[0:24:55.3]  Okay, So although we do have proud of, I'm probably too probably three
[]			 Okay, but it doesn't mean that you do
[0:25:04.0]  Okay? Our night project will be that the use cases another the pieces mounted in heart
[]			 But that doesn't mean that you do not
[]			 A starting implementation on through the master on three
[]			 That's too light
[0:25:17.2]  So starting to your implementation in parallel when we talk about a separate development that we have these evolution already of everyone
[0:25:20.5]  Right? Well, hot while away hand you have
[]			 What is it? Requirements of definitions
[]			 Ah, requirements specification
[0:25:28.3]  You do at the very commander and have mini version release and come back a modify more and more so study with Mark
[0:25:32.6]  Play around the your your your your part
[0:25:36.8]  Did you all order the part teacher about right now? Oh, yeah
[]			 What you waiting for? It takes time
[]			 Are you? No
[0:25:54.9]  Haven't So you okay? Okay
[]			 Yeah
[]			 The cover
[0:26:02.4]  You can use the U S of the camera
[]			 You don't have to buy
[]			 You have
[]			 It is just us
[0:26:05.2]  Speak
[]			 You know, I should also have the record of us being out of the mean You guys
[]			 You're fine
[]			 You don't need to buy you that
[]			 Yeah, yeah
[]			 Even the regular
[0:26:17.0]  The figure that you know us the time we put on computer, you know, positive justice for the people
[]			 Yes
[]			 Yeah, yeah, sure
[]			 But you have to have the the the pie
[]			 Okay, good is wonderful
[0:26:28.6]  So for those that we haven't done that yet, you have to We've come fast
[0:26:31.9]  Okay? And I'm gonna have someone tutorial so we can have some are right here
[]			 I'm looking at right now, So you need it
[]			 Go fast, Okay? Because it takes time to one
[]			 We got away
[0:26:42.9]  Skate it
[]			 So any questions here? Okay, I suggest you today going home tonight
[0:26:53.4]  It is the gold in the Amazon
[]			 Good with the link
[]			 And if you don't want to follow the link, then find something similar is okay? Yeah, just the I suggest really starting work on it tonight
[0:27:03.6]  Today I'll be going Wage, huh? Okay, so this is clear, right? If this is a product proposal, actually, I'm really looking forward to it, because what I really owe propose
[]			 I'm gonna make him
[]			 You put a happy because I have
[]			 What idea would have probably gonna working on and then this is so wonderful
[0:27:42.2]  Okay, so now we can continue our, um Dr um we're gonna finish this lecture today and actually, today I have something I need to I must be attendance I need We're gonna finish early today
[0:27:46.1]  We're gonna finish in six clock
[0:27:47.8]  That means that we will not have a Greek
[0:27:48.9]  We're gonna uncured have a lecture all the way to six o'clock
[]			 Go and take a break, and they can make it up to the time later
[0:28:04.6]  So Oh, I'm looking into the exam for the oh, the decency in our new student under
[]			 So I would how you went
[0:28:08.3]  I heared also back
[]			 How do you have your exam? Okay, this is it where we are
[0:28:29.3]  Okay? She's a where we were
[]			 That's it
[]			 Okay, maybe I just quickly quickly to go over this
[]			 So And I'm gonna finish days
[0:28:50.4]  Oh, this is the Sovereignty Year Review is called a lecture
[0:29:00.1]  I think because from the feedback I get from a student because of the four, probably you even take the sovereignty in class before always many years
[0:29:03.6]  And so this kind of refresh your your your knowledge, your memory, so that I thank you for your feedback
[0:29:10.1]  ASM and I appreciate that
[]			 So this is about of the design
[0:29:15.6]  We come about these island we needed to talk about it wasn't the Zion called it hay the tribute that we're talking about
[0:29:24.6]  So when you have this architecture design, you have ah, few Russians over there on several proposals
[0:29:29.8]  So how do I know which design is a fighter than the other design? And particularly we were talking about the tool design, the attributes that one's couple in when you called cohesion
[0:29:41.5]  And you need to know what's the definition and what do they need? Buy those on
[]			 Now we talk about it some of the decomposition techniques so that I don't know why you have the larger project
[0:29:53.9]  How could we bring the larger project into a smaller component so we can have the delight in the conker imprimatur? For each you won
[]			 How many decomposition techniques? Oh, there
[0:30:00.7]  So they recovered
[]			 This already does a quick a quick of you off
[0:30:11.1]  What is module in the molecules that have a three attributes One is that they must be adjoining in the cold must be compounded, connected together
[0:30:14.8]  You need to have a beginning and the end of Hungary element and you need to give it a name? Uh, I go get it
[]			 I agree
[0:30:20.2]  Gate, identify her
[0:30:24.1]  Which is the name for the invitation Off the soul
[]			 The procedure is object to functions
[0:30:27.0]  Subroutines in the past is all content module
[]			 I know
[0:30:32.4]  We said that they are 22 This is just example
[0:30:35.0]  Before your gave it on Lee, the engage mall gauge on the or gauge on I wanted you design a CPU
[0:30:49.3]  That probably one is, um he sighs I do
[0:31:01.0]  You wanna put a older? You wanna put a the cheaper together to work together to implement what did the richest their function is You have a regency ride shift register on
[0:31:03.5]  It was the air you function with a shaved her
[0:31:09.7]  The shifter said so you use a combination of these functions off those gates and implemented those even achieves
[0:31:19.5]  Or another thing is, you put the option is that you put all the gays together, but they have a very, very massive for communication among those achieves
[0:31:22.5]  So this is a nautical design
[0:31:32.5]  So this is really bring up after two of the the question is water a zagat A design
[0:31:35.7]  So we say the stores, the design is abide her because it is more modular
[]			 On second design is not a good, because it is a very hard I understand what these boxes, what the functionality for each of boxes
[0:31:54.6]  And it is very hard to a nok to what is The problem is, it was the worth of false
[0:31:59.0]  And how do we have any, uh, extension? Your house meant a change to the parson
[]			 And how could away real see each of a component? We just cannot
[]			 But for the 1st 1 we can reuse all
[]			 Hey, taking it out
[]			 This is the richest component
[0:32:13.2]  You're plucking the summerhouse and you'll have it
[]			 So this is the good of design
[]			 So we wanted to you
[]			 Why did you come to the design? We wanted to
[0:32:22.7]  Two principals want to follow one A's
[0:32:27.0]  We want to maximize the reddish in shape within the module to the tighter connection to bite her on
[0:32:34.4]  The one want to minimize the relationship between those that even among videos, that it means you want to have a don't look how to your neighbor too much
[]			 Okay, so those are the two comes after we are talking about is if, um coupling unit cohesion
[0:32:56.5]  So again, the court of desire is a very elusive concept in terms of war
[0:33:00.1]  In a cool is very subjective
[]			 When you say good probably is not
[]			 That is called a four on the other
[0:33:04.5]  People think about what is good, but some hands me
[0:33:11.5]  The chief Esther may be the most of untenable
[]			 Maybe the most reliable
[]			 That's what are you talking about? Those? So? Oh, no
[0:33:20.9]  For those what we call died is color coded the attributes, right? So But it once you have those you can now to satisfy all off those who call it the attributes
[0:33:39.7]  You need to have a tree house menu tonight which one is the most important to you and that you needed to ah, folks on that anything you go nor the least important factors
[0:33:48.2]  So the card of a kind of characters his characteristics are equally applicable to function Or in Kailua Onda object orange it at these eyes
[0:33:57.9]  Do you remember? I told you last time That's the car so that you know that every language is the origin orangey
[]			 The language is right
[0:34:02.3]  We do have some along region called a functional programming languages like, at least right? They're not based on the Faneuil machine
[]			 They are functions
[0:34:14.4]  Or at least like that You have a pearl log those So the artist is equally applicable
[]			 So no, what We talk about the, uh the tool characteristics off a good design
[]			 When is important things caught a component independence
[]			 So that means a the couple in cohesion can very nicely tow the described night
[0:34:42.8]  So coupling is the tick me off in traction between the two modules so you won't have a medium eyes your the in traction as much as possible
[]			 So died her own
[]			 Another concept is called cohesion
[0:34:54.1]  Where is the degree off in traction? Within
[]			 There's a particle molecule
[]			 Now, how do you say within my module? Let it means everything
[0:35:03.5]  If I would say, Hey, there's a political module as a handy 100 0 hello, the photo colors
[0:35:09.5]  So everything we think is a Ford Taurus
[]			 So the court design is you wantto have Ah, hi Cohesion
[0:35:23.5]  Meaning we've seen the module all component as connected as tight as a possible and everything that they are not that compactor is tightly connected
[]			 Maybe it's good idea to put them into a separate module
[]			 I know you wanted to achieve this in low couple
[]			 So everything
[]			 He everything
[]			 My mother should have a minimum relationship with that outside
[0:35:41.6]  Even they have a lot of religion with the outsider
[]			 Now, you better put them all together
[]			 So the good, these eyes a high cohesion, the low covering so beyond light
[0:35:59.7]  You wanna have What a How do you handle exception? How do you identify exception? There's something else right? And how do you do your father prevention and afforded hundreds? This is another thing to consider
[0:36:05.5]  But this is all the girls are characteristic of a design But now we focus on how do we achieve all the couple In the cohesion words that I What is the Gouda? The couple in cohesion design
[0:36:20.3]  I'll give you some examples
[0:36:21.5]  You that like it's alive
[0:36:32.0]  Better be for the, uh, for the tour to manage this exception So normally how how does it does yourself? They were managing exception
[]			 You will accept in happens how yourself there should have
[]			 I should deal with that
[0:36:41.7]  There are several ways Wine first of all, you well alert And then so you will stop another
[0:36:50.7]  Where will you be? You're back to travel to your previous state on the try again
[0:36:54.2]  Try even a route again to see if you'll reach that same exception all
[0:36:59.6]  Maybe just hold it aboard at the beginning, You said you haven't I just told her to give up, so there's a three ways to deal with the exception
[]			 So now let's tell what a coupling
[0:37:10.8]  The company's a zit
[0:37:15.8]  The concept, Really the inter component measure off the strength off the connection between those two systems, so even have very nice user interface I over where? Night
[]			 Nice to the database
[0:37:27.2]  I want to know what's the user interface that in tractor with my database apart
[0:37:31.0]  So this is the final of the scope
[0:37:32.3]  You find it the conch axle off
[0:37:35.9]  How do I break this? My sister hoses into a smaller components, so lose covering is a desirable quality me and that you want it
[0:37:45.9]  You supposed to be on the tube
[]			 You're amateurs out
[]			 You don't want to be
[0:37:55.9]  Suppose a five year I'm just from outside the cooling function, So that means that a component, the changes are unlikely to affect others
[0:38:01.0]  So this is called a uh, impac Analyses
[0:38:03.9]  So why we want a president with either with a more torn up quite a few years ago, but more time, one more time
[]			 And I was still good so that it is that way so early
[0:38:19.2]  The project that Mattis is toe affected their tour another under laws of their requirements and allow this analyzed
[0:38:21.6]  The are from the depository
[0:38:23.7]  We take all their repositories out to see our component
[0:38:30.0]  Regan is out of components into visualize them on
[0:38:31.9]  Then we can't ban
[0:38:33.2]  If I humbly commotion Had these very work tighter, no relationship between them, then it's another very good
[]			 So they from there we can improve the quality off the they're cold
[]			 Come on, you're a cold
[0:38:51.1]  So this really you consecutive we're talking about then? So in other ways that you want to share the variables are controlling information
[]			 Change your leader toe a tight coupling
[0:38:59.4]  So if you have what, uh, before the two come on in the share a lot of all verbals off course, the one change, you must change the other
[0:39:08.6]  So that's a real leader to, uh, the tighter coupling on the loose carpeting can be achieved by state
[0:39:11.0]  Thesent relies on a component combination
[0:39:17.4]  Why pure anger on my sister pricing where I want decentralize it
[]			 So that's the one thing toe have to achieve is, um, the low company here
[]			 So this is the example over the coupling
[0:39:31.5]  So you can see the first, the one we have on cop older
[0:39:35.3]  So they don't totally of no dependencies off course
[]			 This another real scenario
[0:39:42.5]  Because self, our systems, you always have some independent incidences
[0:39:47.7]  But it's just that alleges that treat Yes, she, uh because treating purposes
[0:39:51.3]  So this is, say, a very loose cup holder
[]			 There are some independence
[0:39:54.2]  Among those systems is on the life too
[]			 Right here
[]			 So very good
[0:39:59.2]  So between this and your honey, have one between raise
[0:40:05.5]  You have a two over there on de, so you could have Ah, these speeches of them
[0:40:10.5]  This is a lot of our tied a couple, meaning you have many, Many dependency is this year
[]			 So over here just totally come back together
[]			 So this is just all good
[0:40:21.0]  So the picture on the left the architecture is about her than Peter on the right
[0:40:24.8]  Oh, there's a little bit brilliant, but redraw that later
[0:40:29.4]  So you can't see that this is Titan
[]			 You have more to one load
[0:40:31.4]  European model cnd They all share of the day Heart
[]			 I want to read all this
[0:40:37.3]  Some of the upload this light again
[0:40:42.5]  So this is they all share today, huh? In the middle
[]			 Then everything changes
[0:40:47.9]  One model changes all the other street multi hocked it to change
[0:40:50.9]  Right? So that's it could be the title company
[0:40:53.1]  This is not a good sign
[]			 So even you are the architect
[0:41:08.9]  How do we fix these? What's the best way to fix these with these I What's that? That's the way to fix it is design you This is that all the four motors all share the one that has a decent And how do you fix side To make some more independent, less reliable? Another rely on each other so much
[0:41:34.1]  How do you joint You combine the Modoc Indian But if you complain about your niece to share right so you combine What do you make in a moderate? Larger you know Remember the cool the way off Each module is a performance single simple function as simple as a possible You'll come buying tool that it means that immortal he's coming performing a much more complex the function
[]			 Right
[0:41:56.2]  Listen, may not be a good approach, so we need to feed to the share to the park
[0:42:04.0]  So what does she have a duel yet? Making a several multi toe have their own
[]			 They got right is the part
[]			 Yes
[]			 Nice is a good one
[0:42:09.4]  So what official do is? They said we have motive
[]			 We have more to a date, huh? You're a model p a model
[0:42:15.1]  So you've changed one
[0:42:21.7]  Then you don't have the changes, the other in a way that so if you really have some more common schema together, then this is even a story
[0:42:25.6]  But it is a better dresser
[]			 Have their only injury two modules within them myself
[]			 So this is better
[]			 And then in there my connection among the the modules will be just the through
[0:42:37.9]  Our pity procedure calls, you know, the maybe you sum up, you have been passing just between them
[0:42:43.6]  But instead of what I have sureness a date
[0:42:48.6]  How old? So there are five categories off the coupling and they're not a linear meaning that he's not like equally severe hate going up
[]			 So the data company is good
[]			 You will have the kind of the company is bad
[0:43:07.0]  And you have a stem company contract happened in the common company I would talk about Is that this briefly for you to one
[0:43:09.9]  So, first of all the counting the coupling this is not a cold
[0:43:12.1]  Okay, comfortable party
[]			 The come kind of a couple
[]			 You mean you You have two modules are coming
[0:43:20.9]  The coupling it with directly the reference of the continent will gather
[0:43:35.7]  So, for example, more GOP modifies a state of another model Q Okay, Alamo Dopey refers to a local leader off more You Q In terms with some America displace displacement within it
[]			 Well, don't mean by that evil
[0:43:40.8]  Let me show you a sample
[0:43:48.3]  You took the class off assembly language in the microprocessor costs
[0:43:51.3]  I I'll give you a company, assigns a student
[]			 Why you You're you're You sure? The Yeah
[0:44:02.5]  This So when you take somebody cross the microprocessor? Normally do you have Ah, remember, you have Ah, oversight, right? We even have one
[]			 You saw action right here
[]			 You're You're starting here
[0:44:14.9]  You have what you standing former 00 C No one on this 0002 Okay, Right here
[0:44:25.5]  So why do you have Ah, Amy Trendless
[0:44:27.6]  So what do you have? You have the basis
[]			 This is the, um maybe we make it a, um I'll replace it
[]			 00 We make it easy
[0:44:36.1]  10 and make it
[]			 Is there maybe? Oh, no
[]			 We make it a one one be with you
[0:44:49.9]  One 1011 Okay, this is my my I dress him
[]			 So you have this offset of from here to here
[]			 But this is my beginning
[]			 My subroutines right here
[]			 And you could have This is the model Q And you could have another module
[0:45:06.1]  I don't want you Model p called in Monaco Cure
[]			 Meaning I called his subroutines
[0:45:10.0]  But this summer, teen you started from a your own address right here
[]			 But in my address is really 00 within the local
[]			 But I do have this off said right here
[0:45:21.3]  So you're referring to here
[]			 But you must either the see You have one option right here
[]			 The instruction I have my mother, my instruction, my how my own address
[0:45:34.1]  But this address is relatively told
[0:45:35.9]  My local block addresses, but you must add this offset
[]			 Right
[]			 This is kind of oversight
[0:45:43.5]  So this is the color conquer coupling
[0:45:54.1]  So where you have ah, Model P references to a local diner off molecule in terms of a sum numerical the's a placement with the officer from your pace of the addresses without molecules so that it means that you feel that a change you will kill changer He needed the change to because of my address is changing and also a model p branches into a local label off a model
[0:46:14.3]  So those are the exam pose off
[]			 What is it that comes in a couple
[0:46:25.4]  So why can't the company is not good? Because any change into model Q even just that a re compile Kyul
[]			 Because every time I re compile, I changed my address
[0:46:30.5]  And because you're allocated into the memory space into a new memory, right? So with a new compiler assembly does require a change
[]			 The more GOP, they're just not very good
[0:46:41.0]  So that is almost impossible to a Rios emotional P
[0:46:48.9]  Under tool is I'm a new product without a re user of logical to the snug
[0:47:04.2]  So another car company is called a common covering where these two modules are common coupled with a right of sexual that this global So even a Modoc CC and Mississippi both of them have ox eyes on a change the value off this global variable
[]			 So this is not good
[0:47:13.4]  You normal Turning in the open, Open a system
[]			 A terminal
[0:47:17.0]  What do we call this kind of collision when you have a tool, use auctions trying to access the same memory space on trying to change the vote on that
[0:47:28.0]  A condom? A well, they called a risk on the issue
[]			 Right
[0:47:41.0]  So anyway, you learn the opera insisting my microprocessor remember those Not your your you learned
[0:47:49.4]  Okay, so there's a risk condition that is it really difficult to know which component is responsible for having seven available to a particular value
[0:48:00.8]  You change the I change that you intended it to them
[]			 They continue
[0:48:04.2]  Which one do I get it? So this is not the worry
[]			 Good
[0:48:06.1]  So there's gotta compliment company
[]			 You know you're operating systems that we have a fuel scenario
[0:48:11.9]  We tryinto awards
[0:48:14.4]  When's the Reese convention? Trying to avoid another is dead
[0:48:17.2]  The lock right there look right
[]			 So I'm waiting for you
[]			 You're waiting for me
[]			 I'm waiting for you
[0:48:22.0]  Waiting for me like the philosopher
[]			 A problem you remember
[0:48:25.5]  Feel as a problem
[]			 So they either they see that we're trying to eat
[0:48:31.7]  They need to have a child when trouble's taking other work
[]			 So do I
[0:48:33.8]  Pick up these traversing Your people will tell you what you want and how the way What's that was the way we are
[0:48:40.0]  Wiser? Yeah
[]			 Which way? It was them back
[]			 And use what we address this
[0:49:12.3]  Yeah, The philosopher problem we needed was a son before you sent for giving you the semaphore
[0:49:14.9]  So meaning several reason the flag to see whole act
[0:49:21.8]  Right? So WeII dressed that so this is a risk commission problem? I know we have is a philosopher problem, and that's a really cute a problem
[0:49:33.1]  Is it really nice? I remember when we have these the the banya sore Will Caray did dragon vocal competitors
[0:49:37.1]  So these have the philosopher a few like there are other Chinese philosophy with sitting over there
[0:49:41.7]  Trying to pick up the chopsticks thing is interesting
[]			 So this is the problem
[0:49:43.4]  We tryingto avoid so other couple in problem is that is that the other is the wise kind of control a couple, even one passes it on Anyone have controlled the other, and then also we could have a stomach
[0:49:57.2]  Um Pota
[0:49:58.4]  So even the structure is a positive perimeter
[0:50:00.7]  But the Karamoja operate on Sam about another
[0:50:04.8]  All off the injury individual appear mater's
[0:50:09.7]  So, for example, if you have a the function you have a five year mottos over there
[]			 I only call three of those were in prison
[0:50:13.5]  The truth
[]			 He appear in front of a live on not being called
[0:50:19.8]  Then why I wanted you Suppose it is a true parameters which had never been called
[]			 So that's not good
[0:50:26.3]  So, um so this is not so this stamp
[]			 Okay, Two modules are data
[0:50:30.4]  Uh, did a couple of the even for NPR
[0:50:31.2]  Is it humor? Geez, dinner items on a simple parameters
[0:50:34.9]  All structures off all of the elements
[]			 I use the colder in modules
[0:50:44.1]  Also, this is really the the gold while you have first men the PR meter second of your amateur
[]			 No, it's just that this is a of off the thing had company
[]			 So this is advice
[]			 The one
[0:50:52.6]  Okay, So the importance of covering is that, um the is really chin to mold
[]			 You can change it to another one of the kind of leader
[0:51:09.8]  So the important of all covering his dieter, you wanted to You, um you suppose the minimum pure amateurism, the price
[0:51:11.1]  The wind's really that they had company right here
[0:51:18.2]  I only suppose the Friday members on the first number, the second member and then Joe will cue That's it
[]			 No more If you have more perimeter that you do not use, you don't want to have that
[0:51:25.1]  So nice Move onto the cohesion which is next
[]			 The one we wanted to have a high cohesion achieve them
[]			 So the definition cohesion is the inter component
[0:51:37.3]  A measure of how a unity Feed it together
[0:51:47.0]  Okay, so we wantto implement a single logical requirement so otherwise we don't want We have a lot of inter leaving the 30 designs together
[]			 So hi
[0:51:54.3]  Cohesion is a desirable design called the edgy, beautiful camo component
[0:51:58.5]  Because of one, a change is made
[0:51:59.4]  It is only localize that you're a We think that a pretty good module
[]			 Anything else being changed
[0:52:05.4]  This is just a so minimal
[0:52:12.4]  So just like a coupling, we have a several level levels off, a cohesion identified
[]			 So the good one is a evil mission
[]			 Cohesion
[]			 We can't have a functional cohesion
[]			 The bite
[0:52:25.4]  Elisa Cohen Stangel Cohesion By the name we can see that a coincidental meaning
[0:52:26.9]  There is no logic
[0:52:27.9]  There's no reasons just happened to be
[0:52:30.6]  We sit in the same room together
[]			 So this call here, whenever you talk about this is just the one by one
[]			 So you have idea about why you do your design, what it is
[0:52:40.4]  The defendant took all the design, the good, a cohesion, the first of all coins
[0:52:46.1]  Dentally cohesion
[0:52:53.2]  Is it the only reason I put those the component it together? It's a pizza
[]			 Is it because of my professor said
[]			 I want to make a system or more modular
[]			 Okay, there's no religion shaper
[]			 You perform a simple
[0:53:05.2]  He bungled together the performance of simple, completely unrelated the actions suffering the printer files reverse Genova characters and a pure images and seven to favor the amateurs
[0:53:15.0]  Totally Rubbish, says modules arising from the rules of like every mother should have a between the reviled for 50 complex state A Mensa Okay, you for that to the case and just put it together
[]			 There's no logical relationship
[]			 There's no sequential order over there
[0:53:37.6]  And there's no say the service under the consumer relationship here either
[0:53:42.1]  So why you cost injure? Uh oh, here he is so bad
[0:53:46.0]  Because isn't this greed a mink in the late? Because we have no idea that a component what doesn't do right? He's just having no through things that together on the module is a question of cohesion is not a reusable, because again, there's no single I'd help
[]			 Mr
[0:54:14.4]  What is about What is it doing? How care if you don't know what is it doing? How can you reuse it as the problem isn't easy to fix? So what do we do? We can't breach involved you into a several modules and a performer
[]			 A one task on a single task on the simple task
[0:54:23.2]  So that's that solution
[0:54:30.6]  If I can do something a little bit about her, we called a logical cohesion is inside of the component of performing a similar function are put it together so that a you Eve your performance is serious of late really? To the actions so well, which is selected as the column
[0:54:46.2]  Are you? That means we can have a serious, awful things moving forward
[0:54:52.8]  So where you say you can see that you know, just the example Object for from your body input output
[0:54:59.1]  We want to put them together, or even module that additive insertions, deletions and a modification off a master file together
[]			 Put them together
[]			 So this is called a logical cohesion
[0:55:20.5]  So why a logical cohesion is still not as good, because the interface, it probably is a difficult the understanding in advice because he just a put the performer with the bite of deformation perform a similar function, are cool together on the way
[]			 You're right to the user interface, which your function you really think you're gonna be supposed that that use interface it too
[0:55:34.9]  So, Cody, for more than what actually maybe really income wine
[0:55:41.5]  So if you could have a code again, say the printer, the instructions over there and included in batting into or several cold
[0:55:50.3]  So this is the steel not a easily to be reused
[0:55:53.5]  So frank example
[]			 E for a new have This is the this have this in sequential might write code for you
[0:56:04.3]  Put up with 1/4 for input on Lee
[]			 So this are related to the input output
[0:56:12.6]  But her even you wanna eider? Some are new printers
[0:56:14.0]  So which portion which will change? We changed it all
[]			 The importer which in all our port
[0:56:21.0]  So we deported
[]			 We should change
[]			 So that's it
[]			 Is it difficult? So there's another a logical cohesion all
[]			 So if we move something a little bit about her, he's got temporal cohesion
[0:56:35.7]  The temporal minion is time A really hated
[0:56:42.6]  So if I perform a set of my functions off this a system myself were on the brink depends on the timing features
[0:56:47.7]  So they are the performer a serum
[]			 So actions are related to time
[0:56:52.8]  So, for example, ah, component is using to initialize the system
[]			 Ah, set of war over
[0:56:58.5]  But was such a component of performer, several functioning their secrets
[0:57:07.6]  So, uh, the part of the functions that are related only by the timing you vote is purity because of the time, but doesn't mean that they are logically related to Dennis
[]			 You see, we're having here so that we can put it together
[0:57:21.4]  So you have open automatic the files on the transition fire
[0:57:23.7]  Also, the printer files initialized themselves
[0:57:27.2]  I read it first of all there, and this is puri by sequential timing future
[]			 So maybe in there to function in that they're not really good at all
[0:57:36.4]  So this is a It's a little bit about her, but not the bikes that we can
[0:57:43.8]  So why it is not a good? That is because the action of this moment you are weakly related, went from went together on a strong lady to the body
[0:57:52.3]  Could be a more strong religious toe action yet on the modules so that it means that if I do not consider the timing feature, I could have pulled that off motor into what the other module we should have more strongly functional
[0:58:03.4]  Realistic
[]			 So this is another way Thio put the module together
[0:58:12.0]  So another the only debate by terra cotta procedure cohesion
[0:58:23.5]  Which model has a procedure or cohesion if what he's performing a serious or actions related by the procedure folding Abita, uh, production and so a component of Adam and form a single control sequence
[]			 So there's really by the controls
[0:58:36.1]  It's kind of related to the timing, but it's not a pure by telling, but rather within the control
[]			 But of course, you can see that it controls should go for it, other than being controlled comes after
[0:58:46.5]  But nevertheless, this is Bobby Consider that largely couldn't performing the actions together
[0:58:54.0]  So so for the commune, occasional cohesion a model has a comical communication
[0:59:02.7]  Allow cohesion, even performer as seriously
[0:59:04.7]  Our actions, really by procedures will be followed by product
[0:59:07.8]  But in addition, all action operator on the suit on the same data
[0:59:15.0]  So this really from the communication perspective so elemental off the component, the operator on the same importer or under produce that the same apple
[0:59:29.1]  So, for example, operative, record it in the database and writing to the older the trail, all you can get the new coordinations and then you send them into the terminal
[]			 So these are the same
[0:59:40.0]  You're all right into the same media, the same output properly
[0:59:45.1]  So there's talk about the really device, the one we could've functional cohesion
[0:59:47.8]  So this is the one we really shoot
[0:59:49.6]  How do we put in the relief of the components together? So model with a functional cohesion performance
[0:59:55.2]  Exactly one action
[]			 So on that
[]			 Each component apart neither
[1:00:04.3]  For this is single execution
[1:00:08.4]  You're gonna finish this? I want to check the temperature off of his A furnace
[]			 You probably have a several component, but they all serve the same purpose and check the temperature
[1:00:16.4]  So you ve wanted to a calculated the orbital, the electrons, Then we can have for that
[1:00:23.5]  So how do I calculate that the sales commissions on all the different component together contributor to 18 is all for fuel? That one single Tosca on that it has got only so that's the kind of functional cohesion
[]			 And this is the best
[]			 So why a functional call here is so good
[1:00:43.1]  It's a verbal reusable because we can take a loud usually in the summer of the other systems
[1:00:48.7]  And also we can have is a corrective emitting its okay
[1:00:51.7]  These are weak of your little bit background
[1:00:53.6]  Well, you talk about a sufferer making it, so if you want to maintain that, all that legacy is his statement
[1:01:05.0]  Older systems, if you want to do something Hans vented so normally we performed the millionaires
[1:01:07.2]  We perform the corrective maintenance, sir
[1:01:12.2]  you want to figure some box you wanna have perfected with bitterness perfected
[1:01:13.8]  Minnie's a minion
[1:01:14.8]  Nothing's around with this system
[]			 We just do one of them
[]			 Okay? My zit
[]			 Because even bite her
[1:01:24.2]  So those are the, um the meeting is a type C
[1:01:29.3]  So for the correct information is it is easier so we can easily isolating
[1:01:32.8]  Why? The problem is I know we can have What fewer regression fault
[1:01:36.6]  Do you know what's a regression? Testing is I'm totally zesty
[]			 The regression testing
[1:01:50.5]  Okay, So if you are passive, suffer a system that has the ABC and then why? I have a new system
[1:01:58.3]  What do you do? Do you only ties the new system? You don't
[1:02:02.4]  You have to go back because of all the provinces system again on the record, because you want to make sure the newly added a system and we will not have a negative you factor on the decision system
[1:02:14.6]  So even that it means for the system that is already passed the test in case the season, you still have the rest of them
[]			 This got a regression testing
[1:02:24.5]  Okay, So? So that easy toe eastenders a product for the ad a new function that it is so function
[]			 Cohesion is the best
[1:02:35.9]  So I know how we any information, No cohesion Has the information put them a performer? A number of actions
[1:02:42.6]  Asia has his own interest point with independent, colder for action
[]			 So all perform on the same day
[1:02:47.6]  So from double Lisa
[1:02:52.0]  So what? You two have each other for this component? The layers you talk about the just like a unique side
[1:02:59.2]  You should have the only entry point had his own average to the point
[1:03:02.2]  And then once you're listen, make your easier to just replace the one off the layer with the other there
[1:03:10.4]  And then, um, you can only need to change the Jason that later
[1:03:11.3]  Use your new fix
[1:03:16.4]  Still, in terms of self for Arctic design, this is a terrible three multi user Wish wise, they said the suffer architect to design
[1:03:22.3]  We caught up with layered us over architecture
[]			 Right? This is a layer
[1:03:25.8]  So far
[1:03:31.4]  So this is really essentially this is really the object that option the absolutely that hype 84 object
[1:03:38.4]  So So we finished the tour very important call of their attributes, carpeting, cohesion
[]			 We won't have a low coupling we would have with a high cohesion
[]			 Okay, remember that
[]			 So now, uh, they're true
[1:03:59.6]  Ah, beyond that and our true own things to issues we need to aspect with you consider was how do you do? On exception given identification on 100
[1:04:05.9]  So you want to your design defensively, then it means you want tohave anticipate the situation that a mighty leader to assist in problems rather than you for the reaction you wantto anticipated things happening so typical Exceptions included
[1:04:25.1]  You fail toe providing a service in off course
[1:04:31.8]  That's the exception I want you to give me I Krieg
[1:04:32.6]  Eliza Barton
[1:04:37.4]  I want you just put on my the want to do in the summary out from my shopping cart
[]			 You should fail to do it
[1:04:41.4]  Provided the wrong service Ordina to somebody that you give me
[1:04:45.2]  Include you only get a partial
[1:04:48.3]  They don't give me that result
[1:04:50.3]  Another thing is called a corrupted data
[1:04:55.4]  You know, sometimes we do have this all the time, So those are the typical deceptions
[]			 So what do you do when you have this exception? You have three ways you need to do on to deal with the exception
[]			 Identify them
[]			 And then this is the How do you handle them? The 1st 1 you want to reach
[1:05:13.8]  Why? So you have your existence? Is him right here? Think about I see your the state of machine
[1:05:22.2]  No state a moment when she moves from west to the other prisoner
[1:05:27.9]  Want trigger right? See the moon machines move from a to B
[1:05:31.0]  It's not even trigger I've removed in Iceland
[1:05:34.1]  Another trigger would turn over another sugar
[]			 You wanna know what? So what do you do you want to reach? Why? Meaning that you accept your happened
[]			 You want to restore the system between the previous state going by a one more stage and try again to perform the service is using the butt even a strategy
[]			 So there's a while way to handle the exception
[]			 The next one is you're the correct date
[]			 You want to restore the system until the previous state
[]			 Okay, Go back to where you were before and that you want to cry to some of the aspect of the system and try again
[]			 You do the same with strategy
[]			 So you see that I hate you
[1:06:09.5]  Didn't improve your phone number, right? Input a number
[1:06:16.6]  I could venture continue, so I can buy it a concert ticket
[]			 Go correct
[1:06:26.1]  Another wise, no matter what, You didn't do it right? I just report restored a system to the proven estate
[1:06:29.1]  And then you reported the problem toe our error handling component
[]			 And then you do not provide any service in your report
[]			 So I just give up
[]			 So there's the three ways to handle your exception
[1:06:49.7]  And that is a Your system should have the ability and to perform and at least the wall for his strategies in terms of war
[]			 Because seven happens are you know how to fix that
[1:06:58.5]  So just to summarize the lectern way talk about it was the high court of the design should, uh, you have a high quality design that they should believe a high quality product
[1:07:16.9]  So you need to a decisive Mr Easy to understand implement Under the fourth has Tiananmen tennis
[]			 That's really the the design, the goal
[1:07:21.3]  You want to make a schism? Easy to do that
[1:07:24.7]  So a tribute that refracted psychology user a couple in cohesion, exception, detection and 100
[]			 You know these
[1:07:33.5]  Okay, if all we have examined our first inquiries
[1:07:39.6]  Have you asking this question because you know, you should really take a cell for engine cost
[1:07:41.8]  Those are just very, very basic concept on you
[1:07:43.7]  Really? Sure
[1:07:44.0]  The highway I did
[1:07:49.4]  If you don't know that I failed my responsibility as a professor here
[]			 So I'm gonna ask you this question for sure
[]			 Some of the references you can, you know? So now we know that the system should be a component of based
[1:08:06.1]  I know we talked about a couple of 1,000,000 cohesion Sze
[1:08:09.6]  Now, the next question is that how do I decompose? A big assist them into a smaller component? What should I do? So these lecture, we talk about the techniques and off the decomposition
[]			 So this is, um, designer modular
[]			 We talked about the, uh the designer system isn't really took
[1:08:31.4]  Determine how many components that you have on It was the inter component to relationships
[1:08:36.8]  Interfaces among them that is sentenced satisfy a specific set of requirements that he really is about
[1:08:48.8]  So the question is not a question to you Asia A sistema is a modular one
[1:08:52.1]  Each activity overdose
[1:08:54.3]  Eczema is a performance five consecutive one component on the one important upward as a clearly defined you
[1:09:05.9]  You have clearly defined an importer you heard clearly find output
[]			 So that is what is the I can see
[]			 Oh, now this is a model
[1:09:17.3]  So the, uh, encompassing techniques
[1:09:23.1]  So although sometimes is suggested, the one approach you do these lines is really it's brighter than the other
[1:09:25.2]  I'm s oh yeon practices operate on gator approach you and there's a functional of approach is really just often accompaniment to each other
[1:09:32.9]  Don't you just think about later? Everything must be origin are getting less wrong
[]			 Some homes
[1:09:43.1]  You know, functional design is probably just even better a superior than operator orange
[1:09:46.8]  So give yourself more oceans
[1:09:54.4]  Give yourself more the available the strategy for you to use so good of self trained years which colour should have selected the most
[1:10:01.1]  A property approach for whatever assistant was being designed
[]			 Okay, do not just jump in your opposite orange
[]			 Everything's the object
[1:10:14.2]  So the majority competition Stiles um, the style for the composition, the subsidy we wantto be compelled to compose the subsystems into emoji
[]			 This is really no region
[1:10:23.2]  That distinction between the organization a system organization on the majority conversation
[1:10:31.2]  Where we gonna talk about the visit of the two concepts right here
[1:10:33.5]  What is called a subsistence? I was gonna mold you on their different
[]			 Okay
[1:10:44.5]  The subsidy for Jesus is the 1,000,000 is on, right? Those operation is independent off the service of provided by the other systems
[1:10:47.7]  Meaning, I'm saying myself, it's just that me, me on Lee
[]			 So where is the module? A season component that I provide a service that your other component
[1:11:00.0]  But it would not normally be considered as a separate assistance
[1:11:09.0]  So what do we provide a service to something else? You are probably the supper module where you have with the subsystem is quite a all right
[1:11:12.3]  It's a pretty ah, you dependent
[1:11:13.7]  So there's a difference between these
[1:11:34.5]  So no, How do we I will talk about how do we break the larger systems into a different modules? So, um uh, we can is the subsystems are decomposed
[1:11:36.2]  The into it even more gyoza
[]			 There are two modular decomposition
[1:11:39.9]  Moto's normally is covered
[1:11:44.2]  One is that this is the top of its object object orange
[1:11:46.8]  Either the module
[1:11:51.3]  Where is the system? Is composed Inger into a contracting objects Another way, Ace and more like a functional or intent here was caught a pop line or data flow module, which is the wire decision decomposing into a functional modules which would transform again, put it out, put, you know, just the go sequential manner
[]			 So this is not cannot be described by using object, so those are two approaches
[]			 They are inter related and they are accompaniment to each other
[1:12:26.2]  So if it is it possible that the decision about a concurrence issue to be delayed until modules are incriminating ive almost you have the currency designs, so probably not
[1:12:40.6]  So let's talk about the first, which is there are really a very popular on the you are really from anyways, so the system, these are as a collection off in traction, the object that the system will have A We want to break the system into a set of what loosely coupled the object er with a well defined the interfaces
[1:12:56.6]  So even I would think about a university we have ah, object of the professors were object also on
[1:13:03.5]  The students will object off the other staff, so then they need to have a user interface at the start that Inter connected an interface among them
[1:13:15.1]  So the object or in a ditty conversation is a concerned with identify object of classes
[1:13:22.9]  I know they are a tribute in the operation, So you need to talk about what harmony the classes are having even wanna identify this class
[1:13:27.9]  You know what? The oak tree, the attributes off this class
[]			 I'll give you example next
[]			 So I did what you do
[1:13:36.6]  Your you know, temptation
[1:13:38.1]  The object are created from those crosses on some control
[1:13:41.6]  Probably used the co ordinate
[1:13:49.5]  So, for example, um, why do you talk about a u M u M u m l? Um eso
[]			 So you have this in the name for? There's a class and those are all the attributes off this cost
[1:13:56.9]  But besides, night, you need to have the operation
[]			 Okay, let me draw a picture off these
[]			 This would be the cost of diagram
[1:14:10.6]  Nominate
[1:14:10.9]  Christa Graham has three components
[1:14:28.8]  Why use across the name and this would be attributes and then you have the 3rd 1 Normally, you have something called Operation Operations A's the operation, for example, you want to set the initial value to zero
[1:14:37.8]  The attribute, it would be so classy
[1:14:40.6]  Name is this, you know just depends A bank account to write a caste name
[1:14:42.3]  Actually beautiful would be You have your I
[]			 D
[1:14:45.3]  You have come Member, you'll have your say pass award
[]			 The operation would be you wanted
[1:14:52.2]  Thio said in the past award unusual possible to zero 000 would have So So Operation really changed the value
[]			 Change the value off of these attributes
[]			 Okay
[1:15:16.9]  And most sometimes the So where do you draw the concert? I Gramma operation and it is this optional
[]			 It will not have always have that
[]			 But just keep in mind In a regular cases, you need to have the three components of a class time
[1:15:33.6]  So in the case that have won the attributes that they do not between you and that you would probably not have options
[1:15:40.2]  So this is the front of this disaster
[1:15:41.2]  You have customers to the payment on Those are just the attributes
[]			 And it is even while he's a receipt, I think it is that attributes
[1:15:54.0]  Where does the class names attributes and those are cowardly or the connections among them? Tilda open it, or neither of the design and advantages is that they're losing a couple or so
[1:16:03.6]  The implantation can be modified and, we thought affected the other object
[]			 See if I wanted to change my receipt
[]			 I don't have a change of the other
[1:16:15.2]  So my payment too, right? So it's just that I only needed to care about using your face
[1:16:17.5]  And also the object reflected the reward or anything
[]			 You know, we look at it a real world
[]			 It's really even object
[1:16:25.0]  So you have plans of animals
[]			 You know you have a no, just different as how how things work
[1:16:37.2]  And I also love it or into the language is a widely available so but you're probably faces some challenges
[1:16:47.3]  If you're everything the object or in gator, because the object of interface a change, you can leave these martyr complex that imitates it may be hard to represent that sometimes things are very hard for absent as a object, so you have populi approaches
[1:16:55.9]  You see where is the objective? Here is no object, so it's not a postal, So because of that, we won't have a function or into the design
[]			 It's all the color
[]			 They have law design on the of
[1:17:09.4]  Our typical is a Unix shell
[]			 I use a lot of Unix
[1:17:13.7]  It s so you know why you're using have the pipes? No
[]			 Is totally just a private life
[1:17:25.7]  So it's another Really? So this is probably the for those kind of have a sequential models, which is intensive user data processing systems on the one who's that the function or into the design
[1:17:39.3]  So the humans process is the most you can have a really? Your voice and the identify payment on go this road and you go to send a reminder, hold a suit
[]			 So this is more like a pipeline
[1:17:44.4]  So it depends on what the conditions are might at that
[]			 You just think so
[]			 Why example is called it off
[]			 No analysis
[1:17:54.1]  Where we use a set of what? The symbols of the diagram, which I'm gonna show you right here
[]			 Um, Okay
[]			 Right here
[]			 Yeah
[1:18:02.1]  Um, the diagrams is to see how the is this, like a flow chart
[]			 Right
[1:18:10.1]  So the bandages off, that is, we supported transformational reuse
[]			 You'll have a stage
[]			 Is yours
[1:18:16.3]  Unit Unix of the Shell Commander
[1:18:21.8]  As example in units show you on the least that all the files in my system unless and if I want to use all that l right for all of those
[1:18:35.5]  So you it's very intuitive for organization, for stakeholders, communicator among themselves, it is more long, so on a very easy to add a transformation
[]			 If you want to add something to be changes, I don't want the later over there
[]			 I give example later
[1:18:47.1]  So relative it's pretty simple what we implement because, um, we can't have a sum of concurrent and assisting and we can have with a sequential systems, but it wears off all over Tehran
[1:18:53.3]  Tater is a very hard we're having for concurrency because there is no sequence that were there so that it's hard to have the ideas, the concept of the the concurrency
[1:19:05.3]  So mmm
[1:19:10.7]  So they said we have our own, even the base, that we have a database, the contraction both off them
[1:19:14.8]  So now there's talk about this is the floating mattresses and I we talked about it this march in more detail
[1:19:21.3]  So if you think about us, you have input a B, C, D E f g, all the way to output, right? It's a very secret
[]			 So how do I break? It is a whole long, long line, You know, I said a pipeline into a modules
[]			 Is that How do I do it? So even in the 18 and be related, those set of war A say, Hey, these are probably related to the input
[1:19:44.3]  Then I will have my point out for high to the registration point
[]			 Okay, off importer
[]			 And this is my point off the highest obstruction of the output
[1:19:54.9]  So they can, you know, be the level will be transformed
[1:19:55.5]  Module on the output will be this up
[]			 The model three off them belonged to that
[1:20:01.6]  So I can just the break it installing into this point
[]			 So this is a nice So your your work is toe
[1:20:11.6]  Where do you put these In the cutter line here
[1:20:12.5]  Highs
[]			 The obstruction of input
[]			 And it was the highest obstruction off our port
[]			 So you use it a the exam
[1:20:22.8]  Oh, that's a fusion unit
[]			 So I will have the world on W C
[]			 I use that word
[]			 Come
[]			 So how do we see? How do we work this as a pipeline approach? So at the beginning
[1:20:36.0]  You have this eye, their analysis that I grew up right here value for their and I use it when I see the file names
[1:20:41.6]  And you invited me the names and calm a hominid wars you have on a four mile to the airport
[]			 You this display the final counter right here, So yeah, because I'm out is a pipeline right here
[]			 Everything
[]			 My highest
[1:21:03.1]  The input would be here when you file names on a valid in the file names that belong to the same family
[1:21:04.5]  Right? You, Thomas more guys
[1:21:05.4]  The seem a logical break
[1:21:11.0]  Where is the member of a war? Come to belong to one group and it worries the output allowed one group
[1:21:17.8]  So you have a form right off the format off work hunt
[]			 And this is play
[1:21:19.5]  Work on the arm belonged to the same
[]			 So that's my bring your point
[1:21:26.0]  So if you get a force of our refinement, it would be OK
[1:21:29.9]  You read If I owned a missin and then you go to perform work counter on the Kanda, you are number off your words and your from a display
[]			 The work
[]			 So this is other was the data control passing by the others of the controls
[1:21:43.6]  Passing among them is How do you first of refinement
[]			 But you can see that
[1:21:50.3]  How do you find with the vital her? How did I write these colder? I don't know
[]			 Still, now that eat how enough you can have these
[]			 We have our second refinement
[1:22:00.7]  Where her a tomato juice
[1:22:05.6]  Do you have a read? The file name is a well module guided the import
[]			 Okay
[1:22:09.0]  Like Okay, you gotta perform world count
[1:22:09.9]  We survived the file names on the, you know, format work
[1:22:17.4]  Honda produce our porter and this bullet so I can have a man Humanity from a juice, where have 80 modules
[]			 And then why? Right in my cold? Every right, each single one of them on this
[]			 How do I break? Yeah, the pipeline into these modules
[]			 So sometimes you have a lot more
[1:22:38.4]  A lot of important you see into one input afore you have after the wonder after four
[]			 So now how do I I agree
[1:22:42.1]  Get hit them
[]			 How do I put them together? Is, um probably right here
[]			 This is me
[1:22:47.1]  Well reimport from here with you while you put it right here
[]			 Right on The form here will be one you put
[1:22:57.5]  And then here there's a true together belonged to where output is the three together? Happy round two
[]			 Where our food on this
[]			 So really, it depends on how do you think logically they belong together
[1:23:14.4]  You can achieve all your modules have very of our high cohesion among with the modules and then have very low coupling outside of your mortgage
[1:23:22.0]  So this is the decomposition techniques we have 21 is operating on hater
[1:23:25.1]  The other is functional or indicator right on
[1:23:26.2]  Both are equally applicable
[]			 Do not jump on everything
[1:23:30.2]  Gonna be obvious
[1:23:32.5]  So the sum of the Reverend's here
[]			 So now we talk about that later the quickly talk about it
[1:23:40.3]  Was it a constant eye for the assassination? So when you have ah project, how many month month we're gonna need to implement is a project
[1:23:50.2]  So this is the border cut from right here
[1:23:56.3]  So, uh, the point of the hair ball and said the bunch of the trip I didn't go quickly
[1:23:58.1]  Estimator
[]			 How much? Your next project will cost quality
[1:24:10.0]  What is it? Well, how should I know? You haven't even told me What are the nice part? It is on the heated up
[]			 That's okay
[1:24:12.3]  I only needed to ruffle estimate
[1:24:13.3]  Therefore planning purpose
[]			 Oh, yeah, with happy right now
[1:24:19.8]  And the later you're gonna come back to me, blame me off my wrong estimation
[1:24:23.0]  So this kind of weather, just the a funny and cut from about here cost the effort of estimation so that most of the Oh, yeah, no problem
[]			 You're fine
[]			 And he's okay
[]			 Yes
[1:24:35.9]  Let's say $2 million
[1:24:38.5]  He go like it cannot afford that
[1:24:39.8]  Are you putting you about him for $20,000 away? A year later and he come back? It has seen
[]			 That's it
[1:24:47.3]  Really? You're over, buddy
[1:24:51.9]  Can you show me why? And to the all depends on you for the mural can reflect the image
[1:24:55.5]  So this is I realize the mission extermination in the heart to do hard to the well because most of time we overbite it
[]			 You know, I'm no
[1:25:02.4]  We underestimated the effort of you would take
[1:25:05.5]  So that's why I'm seeing that it tonight and go back home tonight
[1:25:09.0]  Older Your the pies right away
[]			 It takes the You have no idea some things could go wrong
[1:25:20.9]  Okay, Do it early to some of the techniques you can have with an expert judgment on the estimation, by analogies on the practices law
[1:25:26.0]  Surprise of wind him up and the Taepodong on that I, I agree, make cause the modeling
[1:25:33.9]  So I want you understand This is something called Coco More Model
[1:25:40.0]  Your textbook on the test was over Algerian Very beam Hazel from USC, University of Southern California
[1:25:43.3]  And he has a cocoa model constructed Will cause the module where is based on he's a main many years experience of working with your W that eh? How do you estimate how many lines of code gonna cut the need? How many? The man
[]			 Mom, they're gonna need it
[1:26:00.2]  So the current of Russian is a cocoa mo, too
[1:26:04.2]  So is the senator
[1:26:04.8]  Three stated
[1:26:07.1]  I only wanted you to honest Kind of have an idea off this
[]			 You don't have to remember this, Okay? This is just a very complex
[]			 I just wanna you have idea It was somebody asking your hey, when you do the cause, the effort estimation at least you should know some cocoa, cocoa, cocoa, mo model over there, Okay? And they're just that beautiful
[1:26:26.8]  Your purpose on they give you these The four meters in
[1:26:31.0]  Well, the single project for moderate project for you embedded Project on
[1:26:35.9]  They have this a formula that goes with it so simple product immediately
[1:26:38.8]  It's a well understood
[1:26:39.6]  The application developer by small teams uses the formula
[1:26:51.1]  And this is Katie I saw is 1000 designed and the third instruction Hominy instruction you'll have
[1:26:53.1]  Andi, this is the aim is just a few amateurs you wanna apply
[1:27:03.4]  And as you see that the more complex the system A's and the more that this is a the remember you have to 24
[]			 You all wake up to 3
[1:27:08.0]  So the larger the coefficient of days so and I would have you What I am is so I'm you selected through this table
[]			 So really depends on the part of attributes
[1:27:19.5]  The computer attributes a prisoner attribution, You see, like the one for those values from here? Yes
[]			 You normally just one okay on the say, for example, you require something reliable
[1:27:29.6]  A K is very reliable
[]			 It is very low
[1:27:36.5]  The numbers along It was a very high you want to go lot, remember? And you planted that m you know, your previous a formula right here
[1:27:42.7]  There's just a couple of old model and the frogs
[]			 I'm a prison, the out contributor
[1:27:45.7]  You have very disappearance that longer
[1:27:46.8]  Jesu, your viral load, you give a larger number
[]			 You do not have any experience of languages
[]			 You gave what a is a high
[]			 They give you a very low number
[1:28:05.7]  So that means that, uh, yeah, you have a light less in my mouth, and you need Okay, So that's just the way
[1:28:12.6]  How do you and how the root as a barrel be more has those numbers is from a empirical study
[1:28:16.1]  Many, many, many, many billions of lines of code comes a witness, a form letter
[1:28:25.6]  So and also you should have we talk about, um I know nothing that you said
[]			 Um, we talk about a couple of designs right here
[1:28:30.4]  Parkins is the law is a desire by analogy
[1:28:45.5]  So if you have done some project already on you for next time, if you're gonna do something similar project you kind of know that for those kind of a system, you ever have a conversation about you were how? What, like a movement are probably gonna take a two week for finishing my conversation both trying to You know that on this
[1:28:54.0]  So this kind of matter, Ji Perkins, is a law Asian, not a very good one heading since it is, you want to use the older available time off available to you
[1:29:08.3]  So you I see your project one proposal doing in two weeks and that you are uncle to finish earlier because it will have two weeks just finishing two weeks
[1:29:14.1]  You know, that isn't human nature
[]			 Another thing is kind of price
[1:29:16.5]  Toe win
[1:29:18.3]  So this is a florida on the contractor
[]			 So you know, two for them to be the contractor, how much you you'll ask you buy down
[]			 It's a project and $100,000
[]			 And you just say, Hey, that's how much I would take Even you're doing that under your own cost
[]			 But it is just that
[]			 And it happened on the estimate her age
[]			 I started for my my architecture
[1:29:48.8]  Er how many components I have And it wasn't to do what? How much time, how money mum bonds? Or do I need to do the integration and I come from there
[1:29:51.1]  Bring it down
[]			 You even a smaller component
[]			 And now from there I see how much time out
[1:29:56.5]  Where's the bottom with opposite of the opposite
[1:30:02.1]  Where? How much I needed to spend the time to divide the Vatican
[]			 Each individual come component
[1:30:05.2]  I will integrate them together
[1:30:09.5]  I know what you have are the arrows in a week caused the modeling, which is the cocoa mo
[1:30:14.2]  Okay, we'll comb
[]			 Oh, I want to know about it
[]			 And you don't have to remember that
[]			 At least you remember what is about? Okay, that's it
[]			 Oh, I need to know
[1:30:25.5]  So I want to hear No, I didn't like the way It's a part of profession that easily, Just so that's the quicker view
[1:30:34.1]  We finish our review off a suffer engineering, and I really hope that this give you a solid foundation for whenever we move you forward, I hope you're used those knowledge into your project, particularly a product proposals and even later project
[1:30:54.9]  When you talk about awards to function the requirement it was non functional requirements how you designed yourself where the ark images good was the cooler design attribute
[1:31:04.2]  Er, how do you want to say that your software is a good a sovereign system? You have a very knowledgeable professional cavalry to make other arguments for me
[1:31:11.4]  Oh, even for what you presented it
[]			 So I really hope this will give you a good foundation
[1:31:18.8]  I, uh we do have one lecture on campus already called scrum
[]			 I love you
[1:31:21.5]  Take a look at age, scram
[1:31:30.4]  So you can identify because these were related to your homework and I can pick it up later because I want to hear identifying your proposal
[1:31:35.2]  Who are gonna be the A schoolmaster who could be a productive owner? Who gonna be on that? You need to know what? What? The concept worth the entail, their arrest on the bullet hits
[]			 But we're gonna cover these, like his classes, But nevertheless that just take a look at those s o
[1:31:52.8]  We finish this earlier today because of the long I need to be in somewhere on apologize about that, and we will make it happen later
[]			 Okay, But the first thing to do you are getting your about to get your pie today
[1:32:10.4]  Okay? So on the homework, a one party went each team us about me, the wound version
[]			 Okay? Just that everybody can look at those things were a great point
[1:32:17.1]  Thank you very much
[]			 And it review this material
[1:32:30.5]  Okay? Because you are a quiz
[1:32:36.4]  One will be based on all this material and this scooter for your foundation to go forward
[1:33:11.0]  Really? The swan lecture
[]			 Okay
[]			 Yeah
