[]			Okay
[]			 This guy's starting at home
[0:01:03.5]  Crystal off
[0:01:19.8]  Resting on a few things are a canvas
[]			 I created a the groups for you already
[]			 So you shouldn't go there to sign up for your group
[]			 You can organize your own group
[0:01:33.2]  Otherwise, I was thinking I can put you into a group
[0:01:38.9]  You know, I is a blind alley, but I think it's probably better for youto organize your uncle
[0:01:44.4]  So you go to canvass under a peephole, drinking it
[]			 Let me show you
[]			 Okay
[]			 You got a camera
[]			 You go here, you go to a people, you will see a project groups here, and I see some of the group has already signed up Over here
[]			 You can see almost everyone in our cross, and, uh, but how large a class here
[]			 So you go proud of the group, and then you see a set of groups right here
[]			 So So, for example, a group of one
[0:02:54.3]  We already have three Stephen over there
[0:02:55.7]  I really prefer sort of like own every student
[0:03:00.2]  I kind of preferred
[]			 But if you really like you have a four students in one group, so go
[]			 They are to sign up you go fire already
[0:03:07.4]  Sign up
[0:03:09.7]  So, um so you have Adam over there? Um, some off the project
[]			 It we will have our individual project
[0:03:20.0]  But the bigger project when we do the delivery at the India going to the restroom Hi there that you'll be a covert project
[0:03:26.0]  So you go there to sign up, and I can see whoever having a signed up yet here
[]			 And I could just, uh I hope we can finish this school for sign up off by
[0:03:37.8]  Oh, why we have with across next cost okay into next Wednesday as a badger
[0:03:41.2]  Tohave was somewhat kind of personal introduction over there
[0:03:43.1]  Say, Hey, here's who I am
[0:03:45.0]  I know what my expertise is
[]			 How kind contributed to this particular otherwise, why would you want to work with you in a group? You cannot bring any value
[]			 So this is kind of important
[0:04:02.8]  Um, the reason I want to put a student that working because first of all, suffer engineering is a Rita about York
[0:04:12.0]  I could do an individual cost of the group of the project, but that I would do a lot of following the suffer
[0:04:13.6]  Jean is the spirit
[]			 But when you're working in the group
[]			 Some student can contribute more
[0:04:18.8]  Someone stood in the country, not a country that as much
[0:04:25.7]  But what I like to do is each of student you contributed to the fullest your upper lip
[]			 Because we do have even aspect of self engineering
[0:04:31.1]  We have the motive in a part of it
[0:04:33.7]  We have a use case far architect, depart the pie, the programming part
[0:04:38.7]  So just contributing to the full is that with you can't that's always talking about you because nobody's the perfect and nobody can do everything
[]			 But you just cannot do nothing
[0:04:52.7]  So if there's no complain whatsoever, each a group of you have the same mark
[0:04:59.9]  Why would it? Everybody has seen marker receivable for that A project, right? You
[]			 So you have four student
[0:05:04.3]  You have a hate him a 90 or whatever
[0:05:09.0]  But even they really come complains some of the, um the spiel to say Hey, I contributed too much
[]			 Then you have to have something with it
[]			 What? I call up your evaluation
[]			 Your whole team was a four students
[0:05:26.9]  Well, she already is 2500% off your work
[0:05:36.0]  I hope it's no longer the head so that it means Ah, you once did in the contributor more so he got a more than 25% and yet a student to say, uh, he was okay, user Kevin and I as example, we should have won 25 25%
[0:05:52.7]  Right? But you will come and does a lot more So Kevin, you have sent me from 70% off this
[0:05:58.2]  The mark on every have will ever give him 20 Miho 25%
[0:06:02.8]  Even our overall mark is in 98
[0:06:09.1]  I hear you have with 75% of thank you suggested
[]			 So this is computer evaluation
[]			 So it's keeping you mind
[]			 Keep it, People
[0:06:20.2]  Everybody's a contributed equally everybody that we will have the same old mark
[]			 So every student me how? 25%
[]			 25% of 25%
[0:06:29.7]  Those supposed that you have a a day off your project
[0:06:35.7]  It's a whole after product, Professor
[0:06:36.8]  Greedy Your crowded have 18 But you see in that I contributed a lot to you for somebody else
[0:06:41.7]  Country with even more we can get
[0:06:45.3]  I don't want you gotta penalized by night
[]			 So you're distributed A You see I contribute, the more I have
[0:06:50.6]  3% of this student will be anyone on this
[]			 It would be a 25 on a he comfort
[0:07:02.4]  So that means that they have four means a, have you? Hi, Willa
[]			 Uh, right
[]			 So contribute, uh, worked with this guy and I contribute
[]			 Want with this guy
[]			 Okay, So what happened then? We will be, You know, everybody is 25% every student
[0:07:27.4]  Well, goto 88 points out a project and that even in this scenario, no
[0:07:34.7]  But every people country not you have, What? 30? No time of 25
[]			 You have that much more
[0:07:41.4]  You have more than 80%
[]			 I understand there's a progress student of you have what lies about me
[]			 You could say that
[]			 Okay
[0:07:51.1]  Oh, I hope that this is the vices scenario is the worst
[]			 This scenario, his team work
[0:08:03.8]  So why don't you finish your team assignment you by starting nice closet
[0:08:10.5]  You check on Maybe on Tuesday
[0:08:12.9]  If I see some of the students left didn't have any
[]			 Always
[]			 And now we're just What do you want? Anything by a few
[]			 It is better for you
[0:08:20.8]  Introduce yourself
[0:08:23.5]  So this is just the group of salmon for the our first the project
[0:08:29.4]  I already got the license from other company from Norway on
[0:08:37.9]  Have you look for your email? I will write you to my work space and to study, realizes, use
[0:08:44.5]  This is something coming up next and a Ford for the rest
[]			 Very pipe over the in the last week
[0:08:51.9]  Over the weekend, we have, Ah, some discussion
[0:08:55.2]  So I was discussing with the students
[]			 I don't like it
[0:08:59.4]  He's a very, very good of our generous
[0:09:01.6]  We talk about even the ocean is the guy's a pie for you
[0:09:05.1]  Um, we decided a nautical goodbye to the cheaper version because the cheaper worship you have the salt, everything yourself aboard and it doesn't comes with the other senses
[0:09:17.5]  Light on the camera was on a sensor
[0:09:24.7]  Make the to remove that obstacle from your we're gonna buy the kind of relativity come through the worst
[0:09:27.5]  That little bit of Marya spends a wall
[]			 I hope it doesn't have too much going on
[]			 You're fine
[0:09:32.3]  Dollars
[0:09:32.7]  $40
[0:09:48.1]  Did you by force? Um have you bite us in the myself? She was so that's kind of different site and we use a from last semester
[0:09:50.7]  You want to take a soul murder time to assemble those things together
[]			 It was a symbol
[]			 Use it
[]			 But I don't know what you're actually doing it just too much
[0:10:03.7]  Let me just put it on TV about together to never 79 Is it too much time? Finally
[]			 Well, I'll be opposed to find out what the season is on the pie
[0:10:11.7]  What you want you to buy? Wait till tomorrow
[]			 So then you could study
[]			 So today is the last lecture we have these off
[0:10:26.1]  Was a sovereign gene is about Well, this is the material off with undergraduate
[0:10:43.8]  Just a part of that is not the whole thing because I keep it a very important concept of four days to give you to start and the next lecture we starting long more devices
[]			 It's a project
[0:10:56.8]  Oh, last week we talked about what a softer doing is meaning with talk about the vocalist
[0:10:57.9]  While the big topic isn't it
[]			 When we talk about the truth several things When's the requirements of definition under requirements? It's a vacation
[]			 Oh, you shouldn't know about her
[]			 What is? The difference is between requirements fascination and it was the requirement of specification
[0:11:21.4]  And you want to know that? What is it? The deliverable
[0:11:25.2]  So some bridging has all of you about data propose a milestone
[0:11:29.7]  This says, even deliver about even the miles there was a folks out, even holders
[]			 So when I finish the requirements of face, why don't we find out that the final delivery Oh, for the requirements is a really requirement of specific
[0:11:46.1]  And there's a my peen veterinary crime
[0:12:00.6]  Is it definition on a visit this occasion? Is it one too many? Because if one is talk about this thing the holders of hungry, where we can translate into the specific petty second good karma awful would every crime a specific another comes up? The last class we talked about, I wonder you remember it so well
[0:12:14.7]  What is it via navy? When's the validation? And one is verification, you know, was a difference between the validation of verification
[0:12:29.0]  Right? Know this by heart if you are really working yourself engineering people helped us a lot, a lot you can all see and never heard of that
[]			 And I don't know what a difference one is
[0:12:43.9]  Are you building the right car tax, right so the others are u butin the Pride of Rights Union
[]			 It's back of free, Okay, there's no fault
[0:12:51.1]  The first way ace is the product is exactly Will this hold it? That's a huge difference
[0:12:58.1]  And then from a suffering two year in prospect table, we have the methodology or more languages
[0:13:00.8]  Formal replication model referee
[]			 A model verification to verify our your beauty in the part of her rights
[]			 Okay, right away
[]			 That's the contact off requirements
[0:13:21.2]  And also we also talk about what's the ways that we can represent our requirements
[0:13:24.7]  Have what you form a way representative farmers buy four More way
[]			 Present Onda was the difference
[]			 What's the job back Awful, even giving their way to do it
[0:13:42.2]  Okay, so when is it? You could have a very I begin to see if you your natural language on big use about a cool to be easy to understand, but a way you have a formal long rager
[0:13:56.7]  The former Mata specified requirements probably needed a more technical understanding, the mathematical location, but it's a viral worry
[0:14:01.4]  Succeeded Ari Nick
[0:14:16.4]  There's even a job, but defender advantages and a job today we won't you? The second part off requirements Engineering Preserve all was the process of creditably comets reliving the tour lecture
[]			 We're gonna have a Mexican week
[0:14:32.8]  You talk about how do we model e Every promise specific difference between this class and undergraduate class is this crisis build on the foundation off undergraduate
[0:14:34.7]  Something crossed, but we talk about it
[]			 The more things
[0:14:45.1]  So to capture this requirement, you needed to hide for a feasibility study
[0:14:50.4]  Talk about you for the system, our country beauty to the organization goals Objectivism
[0:14:52.0]  You released that? A new part
[]			 We wanted to move on
[0:14:56.1]  Thio someone out of some of your features
[0:15:00.8]  Does that meet our business? Goal has never made our business overall
[0:15:05.7]  Oh, hijacked a prison
[0:15:11.0]  Another thing You should talk about 86 the company and in your end, with a current knowledge always in the body even wanted to move
[0:15:40.1]  Or the Arian five you wanted to the the locator curry Higher payload Rto You wanna increase the speed and you have the technology to do it if you have the money and I love thing is it is a lot of important Of the third item is Every time you have a new system, a convinces immediately greeted it with the other system that are used
[0:15:46.4]  We very often we ignored of these questions
[]			 And this is a value important question
[0:15:56.5]  So, for example, that the work I'm walked out with a BMW, we used the vigilante Asian over their engine conference is a wonderful show
[0:16:00.8]  The defender artifacts on the artifact
[]			 But the question is died
[0:16:06.3]  Come this visualization true, integrated into a BMW or the existing product lines
[]			 You cannot the engineer not gonna use that
[0:16:17.0]  So the integration is a big be a potion from sir off
[]			 You have any new system in price? Well, those are three things you should consider
[0:16:34.9]  Are you starting in your future? Well, after you finish your physically study that her the nexus that went through the requirements and hearing aids Carter analysis our discovery
[]			 So what does that mean? That you're gonna see down with your customers
[]			 So use your homework, your project as example You're proud of you
[0:16:52.1]  Be smarter
[0:16:53.3]  Home right? Product
[]			 What is it? The customer needed even you say are cool
[]			 We're gonna do a baby sees a product
[0:17:01.9]  We're gonna fold out early home using the same one teach about, you know, same thing
[0:17:17.2]  How do you How do your stakeholders, Uh, what do they need it? So you want to talk about it? That domain in all ageing with the knowledge is right here
[0:17:24.4]  What is it? What of the season we should have provided you on the season was operational concentrate
[0:17:25.7]  Incident
[0:17:27.7]  So was the constraints
[0:17:30.6]  That was the the limits
[0:17:35.3]  The progress isn't your function in that particular environment
[0:17:41.6]  So you want to involve a lot of in users and managers and in yours and evolved is the neediness, me expert, all of those kind of stakeholders
[]			 Okay, stakeholders and all that
[0:17:50.6]  Just that a nd user
[0:17:52.1]  Careful with that
[0:17:54.2]  Okay, Anybody who has a really, you know, you have a startup company
[0:17:58.0]  The venture capital is a biggest stakeholder field
[]			 A lot
[0:18:05.0]  The the lawmaker soon regulations
[0:18:07.1]  This all part of state makers understand sort of the stake holders is is much, much broader sense than just India
[]			 This is an example from a library
[]			 You will go the library if you want it
[]			 Even if we suppose you're gonna develop a system for the library
[0:18:35.6]  What are the stakeholders so you can consider you ask a question is interviews will have all your requirements illicit your requirements from that user
[0:18:40.6]  So those are the three I Spector after people
[0:18:42.6]  The pool of people you should consider was in direct
[0:18:47.8]  You has a contract in tractor yet is building expert
[0:18:54.6]  Well, the indirect is the library managers of finance that they decided how many books are gonna buy a new article
[0:18:59.4]  Providers have triple A CIA MPG library
[0:19:06.4]  How to pay money for those digital library subscription? Those are indirect
[]			 They're not in the user, but control
[0:19:13.2]  How? The cell for Levi load
[0:19:15.8]  So now you have What? In tractors? Those are people
[0:19:17.8]  Really? Directory use the library services have users
[0:19:22.8]  You have stare for library stuff
[0:19:25.3]  User, you have a student staff on the external users where you have a library staff
[0:19:31.9]  You have sister managers and the catalogers
[0:19:33.2]  It's provoking into giving me a headache
[0:19:37.2]  And also you have dome expert
[0:19:47.2]  What did you don't expert Do they tell you that was the standard off us systems? And Daria was the classification off? This system given a literature, is the computer broke, sir, And you have something around the history
[0:19:55.3]  So how do you can take a catalogue of those? Those are told me
[0:19:57.4]  Expert
[]			 You need to ask them
[]			 So this is a virus virus
[0:20:01.3]  Curry's ankle
[]			 When you develop a software would have a stake holders
[]			 You have to consider that
[0:20:11.9]  Develop your software so that you have a maximum of affiliate K bi out of you, Mr Holder's holders
[0:20:19.1]  So once you identify those, they're sweet even goes
[]			 I want to
[0:20:32.8]  I want to get to the requirements from so that the next step is How do I get the requirement for user? Let's call that it is patient techniques where the first thing the first days and normally easy to use that you want to interview your customer So you want to eat your smart A whole more a project you want to interview as a baby
[0:20:44.6]  Sit her
[0:20:54.4]  What kind of the things you want to me to you do with your boat or to have you to baby sit with the baby sitter
[0:20:55.4]  Money is your baby's crying among Peter Baby
[0:20:57.2]  Fall amount money to her
[0:21:02.4]  What, So this is I couldn't be informal could be formally interview, so there are two types of the interview here
[]			 Why don't you have a pretty fine the question years? You just don't ask questions under the also some more from your the customer
[]			 Second, just interview
[0:21:20.1]  Where is there's really no pretty fine agenda and you have a range of issues
[0:21:23.2]  Studies for that
[0:21:24.7]  With a humanistic holder, you have a question
[]			 But when you have this interview you with a what? Never, never lost your mind
[0:21:32.3]  Try all the track
[]			 What do your folks out you'll have to have your own
[0:21:42.3]  Y'all mind in this something cutter controlled set of questions? Yeah
[]			 Another thing is kind of scenario based, which is a super super important
[]			 Now, if you're working you either a, I need the larger organization
[0:22:07.6]  The for use a lot of scenario based the requirements because it the scenarios, is folks are some off the agent Erica planning capture the like holder season usage
[]			 So, for example, you have our own design
[]			 You with this
[0:22:17.5]  Why beside you want to think about how the user would be travelers, your website, how they wouldn't be able to navigate your website
[0:22:25.0]  So think about it even a scenarios so you could use a Krieger
[]			 You I just wanted to run over something
[0:22:37.5]  Auction website you create goes on the auction and then where do I go? See my Oh, my The items and I would compare on output of my obedient and so was your step by step scenarios Go with him
[0:22:47.7]  Just I got a What do we call it? What evil questions even use their seed activity's about
[]			 It was the next step
[0:22:54.4]  You have that if you have your design, the sequence off the software, the actions of the contractions are one component to the other
[0:23:01.6]  There were helpful unit requirement visitation as people kind of related to the way the user software on the in a more away from us, something more abstract
[0:23:14.0]  But it to some things more concrete like reminded imager pictures in their mind So that imagine given does scenario za just like your movie
[0:23:23.9]  In my mind, scenarios are particularly useful for ID
[0:23:25.3]  Indeed
[0:23:25.8]  Hell's that Online crime
[0:23:28.6]  The ones you go through scenarios, scenarios
[0:23:34.2]  You can discover you means the summer and put in the stack
[0:23:37.9]  So you would say, Hey, I forgot I had that Ystad
[0:23:39.1]  But you have confirmed before I added that I told you, do my shopping cart
[]			 You could have say I forgot about that because you're only discover that night when you go through with even a scenarios like this is a super super important
[]			 And this is this is used by the industry so much right now, right, so to you
[]			 But in this scenario, is that well, the put a second because we call something a use case use cases is a scenario based the techniques of that which we can identify
[0:24:16.8]  What is that? And it was the use cases in traction, although the name could actually it doesn't mean that they are person
[0:24:25.7]  This is just the a compliment ceased
[]			 Emma is outside that a system that you are a contract with
[]			 It could be a database
[0:24:35.3]  Could it be some external, the dry? Worse if all particular function Could it be some engine say steps
[0:24:40.9]  So this is just the describe
[0:24:43.6]  How about a particular system you interact with Dallas? Well, having set out for youth cases, I know we can give you a possible contract
[0:24:50.6]  Interactions with this is next week
[0:24:55.1]  We can have a occupation with that give you the detail that, uh, because Sam Ho, how do we use the use cases? Use the machine as example
[0:25:05.5]  You with the jaw, People in trouble, that even machine
[]			 And this is where were bigger use cases? A scenario
[0:25:15.8]  A question about a scenario scenario, basically is a very important isn't some have couldn't see it Very right
[0:25:19.3]  Tedious
[0:25:25.7]  But actually, because of those details, you you may ignore anything that painted in tool
[0:25:27.0]  Making yourself great developed
[]			 There is some buck you
[0:25:32.5]  Nor is that so the better we defy our use cases
[]			 Just thing about that away could develop our work
[]			 Our assistant
[0:25:41.8]  So don't think about use cases just like a excises
[]			 Only it is really leading to the development of yourself
[0:25:48.3]  The way I work with Erickson
[0:25:48.9]  You stock home
[]			 That's it
[]			 Use it so that the pattern you're writing or use case better you can have yourself
[0:26:00.4]  So secrets die, Grandma, he can id a deed healthy to use cases
[0:26:06.5]  I show you what's the sequence of the season but interacted with each other
[0:26:14.1]  So from somebody you have, go to the library and you need a log in Sedaka your books and then you needed to compare how much of the boy you can borrow your check out
[0:26:22.3]  And then you can send a reminder you have a part of this book for two weeks and you bring her back
[]			 So those are the secret
[]			 Is the action people moving along with those scenarios within the system? You are a good idea future
[0:26:41.4]  I'll have you this season gonna be tied up when they finished after the deployment
[]			 So scenario requirements are really leading to the activator design in a while, but the important their future is so Suppose you have a one way to design software for few the same thing
[]			 The library systems
[]			 You have no way to be signed a software library systems
[0:27:04.4]  How do you decide which is the design? We covered herself for architecture
[0:27:09.1]  Would you design is bite her than the other? Actually, you self aware there's no bite her
[0:27:20.7]  It just that you would you contact? We always talk about a context that why would help what a software engineering? Because you will relieve our contacts and nothing because everything's already so
[0:27:32.7]  In the heart of a scenario based on the development is something called eight hands architect retreat
[]			 Awful analysis
[]			 So this is really talk about it
[]			 If I have different scenarios on, I can't decide on this particular architect designs about her many other architect
[0:27:45.8]  And that is a really based on the trade offs
[0:27:49.0]  Okay, I see I ism is something even to know for your career
[0:27:54.6]  S e I They said, uh afterward
[0:28:05.4]  He said he killed is a part of our CNN your right, Carnegie Mellon
[0:28:18.7]  So this is a one off the leading research institute in the world doing intensive with suffer a system via of our frontier
[0:28:26.1]  They do a lot of work with the D o d Department of Defense, so they are worked out
[]			 Really? The front here
[0:28:30.3]  I suggest you go to the C I a website
[]			 I see
[]			 I thought of seeing me without you, a local to see what they're doing
[]			 So they give you a much of mount A broader sense off
[0:28:52.0]  What? The happiness the world regarding some engineering Wouldn't of researchers Research project
[0:28:56.0]  What? The methodologies over there
[]			 This is very nice given story for you to get in a state of the art was Yeah, So I see
[0:29:10.9]  I don't see him, you'll see em
[]			 You're the Carnegie Mellon University
[]			 I just spent a whole year there last year
[0:29:26.3]  So this I said on the days eight hammer we call 880 a ama architectural finality is the method by sea Ice sisters
[]			 Come here
[0:29:37.7]  So now we talk about that requirement that Vienna v again that we couldn't I couldn't ever size of this enough
[0:29:47.7]  I do requirements that we need to make sure that we produce the right product on to make sure they produced the product
[0:29:53.0]  Right? Well, in the sense, that idea, it's a concern of it, of demonstrating by to the requirements of the finest Txema that the customer really want
[]			 Right? So I give you an example right here
[0:30:11.1]  So how important the requirements that remark with crumbs of right is it and cost this so it requires the arrow cause that are high
[0:30:17.5]  Where, right? Huh? So you think your season has abarca feeds? The bargain is expensive, but you'll have the varga I did
[0:30:31.0]  The record is a level that he means a along the way that mistake carry on to the design to the implementation to the employment so really amplify visit Arrow 100 times is expensive
[0:30:40.2]  Suppose you have You need their fingers to the bone
[0:30:47.2]  You find the buck at a requirement on value of finding problem at a requirement of face
[0:30:49.9]  Spend a $1 fix that bug
[0:30:59.0]  You didn't find it, then you have to spend it up about a $20 when you threw that imitation and then you could have spent almost the $100 after you pose it
[0:31:05.3]  Deployment of yourself for assistance
[0:31:09.0]  He's a Barbary dispensing then just facing
[]			 Because of that, we really want to get requirements right on in the first place
[]			 No, we come to it
[0:31:19.7]  Lena v, for requirements
[0:31:26.3]  So was the validation in traumas over requirements, repetition in general, sense of meaning that I reproduce the right of her doctor
[0:31:41.8]  So the bad additional requirement meaning we have a correct and requirements as stated in that your requirement is truly a good reflection off
[]			 What is the customer need? I want this way beside it
[0:31:53.0]  Easy to navigate I want This is rather simple continous century design
[0:31:56.6]  What do you give me? A lot of lot of pop
[0:31:59.4]  I'm a lot of the flashes design
[]			 You think this super fancy
[0:32:11.0]  But that's not what I need under the henge is a verification requirements is stated that your, uh your corrected I imagine you have the right away
[]			 You put us everything's you what you're saying you're seeing there right thing
[0:32:23.4]  But are you even prices in the writer ward? So this is, uh, Veena
[0:32:26.7]  Translate into the requirements and you should have paid attention
[0:32:30.9]  Attention
[0:32:35.0]  So what was that? Things were reading to ask When we do the V m v check means a check, but it does the system provider the functions we did by the support of customer needed
[0:33:00.0]  So if I wanted to of the season be able Thio support your you're gonna go in Asia, I had experience of working with, well, my colleagues and Clark collaborative work
[0:33:05.2]  I work with howdy airline that the Web systems
[0:33:10.7]  So whatever you put your air ticket right, how way through? So you said I don't This is not what I want
[0:33:16.5]  Rice
[]			 Another writer
[]			 Or maybe the connection will be the too long on the way over to love
[]			 There's no way for you
[0:33:23.0]  Just a bag of tricking just a waste of a back tracking you have to start everything all over again
[]			 This is not a very smart design, right? So there's something you need it you only can experience, though
[0:33:52.5]  So when you're with your reservation for your scenario based, uh, well, cop So you want to ask you a question? Is the consistency Are there any conflicts of requirements? So, on what hand you available? Some, uh, Microsoft microprocessor chips
[]			 I want to use that in India space
[]			 You wanted something to super light, but you still want that more powerful until you give a bigger, more bigger chips
[0:34:06.4]  There's a conflict with a comment
[0:34:12.0]  Do you wanna just more powerful? You want a super light? Well, that is the in Cassie's
[0:34:13.1]  Completely
[0:34:20.2]  How about a company that Mesa are all functions required by the customer? Including So although you need a proper are all the customers requirement? But even a stakeholder haven't even requirement
[0:34:32.6]  So have you Included Are all the requirement for more? All the Venice *** holders use the library as example
[]			 We have a director
[]			 The user
[0:34:39.6]  We have indoor use
[0:34:43.8]  We have so many experts you used, including all of those on a really Esma cannery crime is being implemented and even available budget on the technology
[0:34:59.5]  You want to something the super fancy you see? Said, Oh, I wanted the season with superintelligent
[0:35:01.0]  Recognize you are you see? Hey, we have a little knowledge of bringing company in your face right now
[0:35:10.9]  Part of my research, if I want to see Oh, my God, You were to catch your eye on your sister
[0:35:12.6]  Marina my mind
[0:35:15.7]  And know what? I'm a week, right? This is just a joke
[0:35:18.3]  One of something more realistic
[0:35:22.9]  Do you want to verify a bullet kind of requirement? Be checked
[0:35:26.2]  So how do you know that? Meeting user
[0:35:26.9]  You cram it
[0:35:28.0]  You are safe
[0:35:29.6]  Foster would mean faster is a five second of fast
[0:35:33.2]  Let me say twist alone
[]			 I was five minutes Second is a boss
[]			 But you know, sometimes I come here to five minutes by second agent
[0:35:43.6]  So can you give a verifiable the requirements? I need to talk about this later
[]			 It's a change
[0:35:51.8]  If you wanted to hide comprehensive ability, you know which that requirement of puri curry prominently on the student
[0:35:58.9]  You talk of a lot of opinion, Coach Arkansas even work with the engine control
[0:36:02.3]  Say c'mon
[]			 You said how the engine needs to be
[0:36:05.1]  Have a collaboration
[]			 People
[0:36:07.9]  Before you have these in the singles, the one particular function to another function
[]			 Okay, I don't understand that
[]			 Right? So you need to understand
[]			 What is it? It's the easy toe
[0:36:17.4]  Be understood by, uh, your engineers Tree's ability
[]			 I couldn't emphasize of his enough
[]			 This is so important
[0:36:28.5]  Here's a blanket
[]			 Probably
[]			 This is the most important
[]			 This is the problem
[]			 The most important offer
[0:36:41.4]  What requirements Unit? Belk image
[0:36:43.6]  She's a bit of the equipment
[]			 Several things
[]			 One is, um form your requirements in
[]			 You have what requirements is definition
[0:36:58.8]  You need the trees of 52 requirements and specifications
[]			 And this is here
[]			 This is one
[]			 This is money
[]			 Money right here
[0:37:14.4]  So that means one divination come, transit can be translating the minus specifications
[]			 I give you the example
[0:37:22.8]  Last time you will see that the library system was to be able to read a even a vile heights
[0:37:25.4]  How do you translate her that the sentence must be happy? F i o j
[0:37:32.3]  Pedophile MP three file and P 44 translated
[]			 She's a lady from a specification
[]			 You to your design, that's it
[]			 Could be one toe my name, my people again because it was visit occasion
[0:37:52.9]  I have many might even a design implementation of design, right? So you could be recovered at the design architect of the design, the architecture
[]			 We could see the market help and then they have a implementation
[0:38:10.1]  So here one thing is I come home any minute, even a even the way to imprint and use different languages
[0:38:13.5]  Use it even though that happy's you can people that even a using the face
[]			 So this is it
[0:38:24.9]  So for anything, we must be able to track a back and forth
[]			 So any implementation component must be able to track back to where the design
[]			 You must know that I know from every design you must know where the specification A's every city
[0:38:38.1]  Specifically you must do you self engineer practice
[]			 There is the one thing normally people ask about it
[]			 This is a question I want to ask you
[0:38:55.1]  Say, Suppose I have visit be the suffer a component to say opportunities, Facebook or other insisting you know, there's a particular compliment that's another being used for the next generation
[]			 But There's many minutes, even
[]			 Really, He's right
[0:39:07.2]  They even component another being used was your piece decision
[]			 You're the architect over the Facebook
[0:39:12.1]  Do you take that? A producer content component out
[0:39:14.0]  Are you leaving? It's a compliment
[0:39:18.8]  What was the audition would be? You understand my question
[0:39:29.2]  Suppose you go to Washington to goto Wharton three
[0:39:37.0]  You release on any old version and in some other component in the system I phoned why they would keep operated
[0:39:40.6]  I wise, you got a perfect component obsolete
[]			 Not being here
[0:39:51.8]  Is that any more? You leave that a component? Gonna say C'mon, are you want to take it out? How can be independent? Is it gonna be? Um, yes, that's the component in the season was gonna be
[0:40:00.3]  All comics are gonna be having any on the relationship with arrest the component, but it just gonna be used by Washington to butt in the Washington D you find gentle speed? Is that Irene? Five as example, I revive the super Super Foster that I remember our first lecture
[]			 I give you the example
[]			 No one
[]			 I should have thought about it
[0:40:24.8]  He studied for It's good that he's got a thing for you
[0:40:28.7]  The French, the rocket assisting See Hi already fly for is super good Super cool But we want to carry three paid off three said the light is that were too because if they go to the space is very expensive Let me the three company case Year three customer
[]			 I shared the same with me
[0:40:46.4]  Shit, you know, positive kind of curry to save the life
[0:41:05.0]  I wanna come with three on my speed is a fast There's a lot of change from very far five toe iron four speed is a higher by the payload is hire some of futures in Iran for and non benders obviously
[0:41:15.4]  So do you even know the architect off of these in the Aryan Five Arocha assistant, What's your position would be if you leave with us a steamy letter? Oh, there's a feature, you know, Use the buyer
[]			 You know what you want? Why bag or compatibility? Because of, um yes, back home
[0:41:39.3]  The fact that version compatibility listen Morning for operations is demon Father for these case
[0:41:43.8]  We want to increase the speed of the increased the payload
[]			 This is really We don't wanna There's no season
[0:41:48.8]  We're gonna run your own mate too, right? So there's another upper and 16 is now the compiler
[]			 It's okay
[]			 I wouldn't know what you are
[0:41:54.7]  Version So have high found, right
[0:41:57.6]  These pylons were running on the lower the older version of the pipe
[]			 Good
[0:42:13.7]  What do you think? Yeah, I'm I'm not asking you
[0:42:14.3]  Should I remove the component that not being used by your work? Keep reading, Mrs
[]			 Or I should remove it from this
[0:42:28.7]  You should have thought of being in the USA so much if you remove it
[]			 No
[]			 Well, of course you have long says only
[]			 Yeah
[]			 So some things
[0:42:37.4]  Anyway, it reached the king by his own community
[0:42:41.5]  You should apprise it is about invite away
[]			 Oh, you talk about your price
[0:42:47.6]  Your father, he says the learnings
[0:42:50.6]  Do they think I hear your question on once? You finish a tall right to the body
[0:43:07.8]  I guess I'm just kidding
[0:43:09.1]  Need a sound in the future just because the future
[]			 Okay
[]			 Just like you keep something your home
[]			 Okay? I don't want to do with the way, just in case
[]			 And, you know, the answer should be like, what, Kevin talking about you should remove that
[0:43:33.0]  That's because I don't What happened? You are you? Because sometimes if you have this a hungry no competitions, What you do is sell for testing
[0:43:39.0]  You wanted testing already and one have is a boundary commission
[0:43:41.7]  So they're something exceptionalism quality
[0:43:46.2]  Not, uh, you cannot anticipate it before who? The trigger That a particular function being called? They're just by accident
[0:43:55.2]  I never could cause a bee that he's asked
[]			 That's it
[0:44:00.4]  While the problem is because, I mean, if I were failed, this'd a crash on the maiden flight
[0:44:05.8]  Well, it was something novel working
[]			 You really should just more that now that I have no future
[0:44:12.9]  How about it? Did I submitted the kind of practice
[0:44:16.8]  So the triple is extreme, important everything
[0:44:19.9]  You have any stadium, your sovereignty, but a moment you must be able to trace it back to enjoy
[0:44:37.8]  So the tree's ability So nothing has cut a ability kind of requirement of being changed that they thought that a large impact on other promise there's a part of cover impact analyses, a wealth of my project
[0:44:40.8]  I worked with the Motorola when Martin I was here is really working without requirements
[0:44:48.1]  and then bag in that a project of the recently read either with them
[0:44:50.9]  So when they chillier weather requirement, even Rick Rama has this dependability you become
[0:44:55.9]  The aid depends on the crime that be
[]			 So every time you change a you must change your crime that be as well, right
[0:45:08.8]  So otherwise, if you think we'll feel so this is very crumby change of without that large impact these concepts of impact analysis Although the indeed techniques, how do you make sure that you have you come to the writer requirements on your state of the requirements of right? One way to do that is kind of a promise of review
[]			 So which we won't have a system mighty good
[0:45:37.8]  My new analysis, obviously requirement where they have ah you doesn't review gold with even a scenario is that investors see that cover require massive review me in the company Have they reveal they called a radio
[0:45:47.1]  Now we have a requirement review colder reviews that one must see
[0:45:59.7]  How did the cold right? Never requirements in review is that we want to review the analysis manual process and then a fireable to be cut a Perth Hyd This is so effective perv, having given use or something tangible giving you to something is easy to understand that more visual in the way that because some excusable model he's cute
[0:46:12.1]  I'm motivated
[0:46:16.1]  Even is a website something user country of worse can conclude on the move on the next for one page to the other
[0:46:44.2]  So this is cable on season, really contracted from the type of all the requirements and also you wantto how's the case of the generation? You want to be valuable that has the cases to pattern on a personal assistant for has the bullet and that one particular scenario something we called it is pretty, uh, fashionable in the particles of paste
[0:46:51.2]  Even you're an apartment
[]			 Yeah, baby, even you will work with the software
[0:47:02.7]  You know, we have a company right here in the Western called the ultimate This afterward
[]			 Yeah
[]			 So I had a i The positive
[0:47:18.3]  A few amount of the seven years Each year we have those engineering come to my class gave a demonstrator what is the has a juvenile about a woman
[0:47:24.5]  And that's a big practice in the ultimate itself to work on each year I really send a few students from my class worker there full time
[0:47:36.2]  Them is beautiful company in the world or bite very good company for the counter student
[0:47:43.1]  So what it has in Germany Problema ese, he said
[]			 Over your right of the cold has a code
[0:47:49.5]  We ride archives
[]			 The code has the case of forest
[0:47:52.9]  Before we'd write a force the lion
[0:48:07.5]  So that means that they said we'll be 100 personal, covered our code that would be 100% of covered by I mean in this way my past, the cases in my belt contagion
[0:48:08.9]  I don't need to write a double take anymore
[0:48:11.6]  He's a lying Koda is doing what is for the through See the people in your era
[]			 But I don't need a ride
[0:48:23.6]  I rose to the occasion as my documentation
[0:48:35.8]  So also I nothing is kinda automated that come seasons of analysis, and we want to check the consequences off a structure on the four more requirements
[0:48:38.9]  Sophistication
[0:48:46.2]  This is really has touched the ultimate suffer engineering, you know, for more longer your former specification a transformation
[0:48:56.0]  It all belonged to the dummy on a huge huge A researcher in days all the you know, for the bigger companies that a lot of things is just automated, the transit transformative
[0:49:02.1]  Then I would hope that a tree's ability and I want you put a three stars on my notes here worry very important tree's ability
[]			 Okay, I couldn't emphasize enough
[0:49:10.8]  Oh, if we would have ah examine This must be on the exam thinking about traceability concerns by to the relationship between keeping the requirements of their source under the system design
[0:49:30.8]  So that means that everything you do you must be able to treat back was the Russian house for me and their three kind of trees of meditation
[0:49:33.5]  Why's it from a source of trees? But it tastes
[]			 It's a links between requirements
[0:49:36.0]  Thinker holders who proposed the nose of it, I promise
[0:49:42.9]  On the nights of from require mysteries, ability was being between dependent requirements
[]			 So we talk about a dependent requirements
[0:49:48.8]  Mia
[0:49:50.5]  You have a requirement 80 Penhall requirement being a letter
[0:49:56.9]  If I must do that, they are sorting first in orderto peak that the largest value from the whole data set
[]			 Then that's it
[0:50:07.1]  They're dependent requirements and that also you have the design interest billeting, which is the links between a requirement to the design
[]			 So go you back to my my the picture right here
[]			 This is really what were we talking about here? You need help
[]			 Even a requirement that this is requirement dependability
[]			 And this is a form of designs on this
[]			 If for implantation, you must be able to have this two ways
[]			 Yeah
[0:50:31.8]  Traceability, wagon 1/4
[0:50:35.4]  And, um wow
[0:50:36.0]  There, south of where we could have used case cut a record of the pole
[0:50:43.2]  This part of the IBM are sweeping
[]			 The price is truly, uh, IBM, right
[]			 I'd have cut a rational additional software
[0:50:55.0]  Was bald by IBM
[0:50:57.1]  Original a week into fights
[0:51:05.0]  There's no civilian adviser, is it? A set of the tooling for a lot of scale on the industry
[]			 Develop or mention over there you have, ah, configuration management
[0:51:18.6]  No, you use a kid, have for your configuration monument the night over there
[]			 You can see a clear case, you know, clear question this out of a configuration management and then you have these a rose
[0:51:33.9]  It's another droz
[0:51:34.5]  Okay, just abbreviation you also you have, um, record
[0:51:43.2]  See the prole cool Registry Parole manager requirements over here
[0:51:47.1]  And this is for the U
[0:51:47.2]  N
[]			 No
[0:51:50.3]  A visit for comfy, comical region portion control
[]			 Okay
[0:52:00.7]  Vases for requirements
[0:52:08.3]  So you are using even we're gonna use these touring
[]			 I think we have that he started
[0:52:11.9]  It was like at that license from Ivy Emma, where clear day
[0:52:15.9]  You can see the dependence that depended off even a requirement to give you a table right here
[]			 So what are? I think I'm gonna show you later
[]			 You I think I have one off those saliva you have even table say there's a requirement of one
[]			 This is a requirement, and they should even these were having depend on these
[]			 Then you can use the older depend
[]			 Not that
[]			 So
[0:52:42.1]  Every time you do any changer for particular requirement, even they are
[0:52:47.1]  Is there any dependencies among them? Immediately the software gonna show you a writer cross over there if he needs a dependency was broken
[]			 You have to fix that
[0:52:58.0]  I mean that everything you wish, every change, this requirement, you must change about her
[]			 The software we control that for you
[]			 Very nice
[0:53:13.4]  So this is just another way to implemented a tree's ability This is a thinker from the requirement to design
[0:53:18.9]  So this is the Tripoli the magics off course
[]			 This is just the paper, but its software manager for you
[]			 So you have required in the 1
[0:53:25.2] 1 point you this, uh, a direct you promise requirement for 1
[0:53:33.1] 1 depend on from 11 tool
[0:53:36.1]  And this is a justice
[]			 See, I they are I was director required
[0:53:44.1]  The dependent one's kind of in Dr Depended on this just to show you the magics
[]			 Meaning just that
[]			 What do you get it from? The is you don't make any change of either
[0:53:56.0]  Put a requirement that you must consider how the other crimes otherwise you'll suffer will be wonderful
[0:54:03.0]  So for the true wing, the sovereignty to supporter What is the case of P I
[0:54:09.6]  C? It was supported
[0:54:13.0]  I said a men off the acronym You learn from this car
[0:54:19.9]  So you need to remember that because when you go out and how to your potential for years
[0:54:23.2]  And you wanted to speaking the professional panic over Hillary, You don't want to just talk about it
[0:54:28.7]  These that better in bed
[0:54:43.8]  What is the case? You still remember, huh? You don't remember looking to the unknown? So Kay was a case to it
[]			 I'm not just you don't know
[]			 You better remember that
[]			 We know this answer
[]			 Yeah
[]			 You hope? Yes
[]			 Yes
[0:55:07.9]  Oh, this is really computer 87 Engineer
[0:55:12.7]  So the people of confidence that will cover around that, you know that
[0:55:17.3]  So we have How high in the tubing? Which is the four the manager requirements
[]			 I have a lord
[0:55:26.6]  I would truly just do your the middle level we meet is the ID's right in the I d
[0:55:37.0]  Why would I need measure? I think you could give me example with IV's
[0:55:37.9]  Give me one example
[]			 Okay
[]			 Yeah, I believe so
[]			 Yes
[]			 Yes, it was I being He's right
[]			 Yeah
[0:55:45.9]  Beautiful
[]			 What? Yes, you does
[0:55:49.8]  That cleavage, you know, just I know there's a planet forms so I don't have with the larger the high level
[]			 Okay to is the requirement
[]			 I just talk about records
[0:55:59.8]  The parole clear case of career
[0:56:01.4]  Quite
[]			 It is all the high level one
[]			 You gotta have a media level, my manager, the ark picture
[]			 So you can have this
[0:56:09.9]  The id's of for the lower compiling a for you all
[0:56:11.7]  You can use the uniqueness of the command, right? So But what can choose you mention requirement You want to manage a you know, a skewer
[0:56:21.3]  And the manager of the store on a change of management at the process of change in management is working pro process
[0:56:39.6]  The at the stage of that, we find on the information flow between on the stage, uh, also made it So have you from a requirement to true that these on how we do that automatically you're some humble have the you only use the mold of your language
[]			 We would help those So you can have a example
[0:56:54.2]  How could they implement that on having traceability management? Automated retrieval off links between these requirements? That's the weather, the records
[]			 The pro can do it
[0:57:06.7]  Another requirement, is it? What is it? The tooting providing Truman could've Taurus the door like a b o a
[0:57:10.0]  R on a company
[]			 Using that manager requirement
[]			 He was a You have a lot of crime
[0:57:18.1]  You can just another managed by the world water anymore
[]			 I'll give you example
[]			 Um, our phone right away
[]			 How compact
[]			 With the for me
[]			 How compact you know she was
[0:57:28.5]  Your friend's name is for members, just for the contact to to write that a requirement of harmony pages
[]			 We would design a phone
[0:57:48.1]  Oh, how do you how the component that over the contract should be developed? Oh, sure, they'll have what they need for the field with rain
[0:57:50.7]  Helene could even how to make a connection
[0:57:59.5]  Isn't my brother meeting my brother together? And how that integrating with the back there
[0:58:01.2]  Right, Stoffer, this is a phone
[]			 I'm the pages, the better
[]			 I don't know about that
[0:58:09.7]  I pulled out because I know, but I work a puppy in a hole and I know how many pages
[0:58:14.2]  Wonder of it
[]			 There's a lot
[]			 It's another tool page
[]			 It's about the model
[]			 There's a lot
[0:58:25.6]  It's emotional
[]			 So we finished the requirements
[]			 Okay, there a few items that wonder you're honest than requirements
[0:58:35.0]  One is that was a definition even the requirements of hikes
[0:58:37.8]  Another is a requirement of Una V
[0:58:40.6]  How do you the requirements of a recitation on how do we also even a ways for us to a prominent in this station on how to weigh manager requirement bases? Hey, you ve techniques going to know that we moved a design
[0:59:05.8]  Um, maybe we can take a quick break before, have you, sweetie? Through a design
[]			 Okay, take a 10 minute break
[]			 10 minutes
[0:59:12.2]  Break a priest
[0:59:14.9]  Cool attitude is a mortar
[]			 It's started again
[1:09:14.7]  So this part of the lecture we talk about design designs just is the bridge between the requirements on the implementation and that particular requirements that we're talking about
[1:09:25.0]  It's not a requirement, a specific destination, but a rather it is a requirement specification
[1:09:33.4]  You see what I'm using here particular? I guess it is a term called it requirements Specification
[1:09:35.7]  That means is the translation in a packet nickel term? Awful
[]			 The same requirements, but a stated even more in the more, uh, from a technical perspective, from the implementation perspective on this at this stage, we're talking about which, along with your gonna use which, as it happens, use it
[]			 What kind of a multi we're gonna use
[]			 We kind of service that we use
[]			 How do we get secret? Those? So this is really the requirement they were talking about
[1:10:06.2]  So it is already talking about a requirement of the service specification on the colder construction near the imminent agent Power to the design refines the abstract specification into something more concrete, which is a human condition
[]			 God, a lot
[1:10:28.3]  So in this state where I said, we're moving along the life cycle, we become a mark hacking Nico and become more concrete if you've become more detailed
[]			 So I go up up is more abstract
[1:10:44.8]  It's more vague is more in the later last 10 foot margin generic general did The Zion customers are silver endures on the programmers and sometimes the testers
[1:10:49.2]  So that's really ho's
[1:10:50.4]  The stakeholder hoses
[]			 The people can't consume that
[1:11:06.7]  These I The information is so far and you know it, right? So we talk about the desire Carla, normally referring that it's you architecture design, which is a process it concern over the establishing a basic structure framework that identified a major component on their relationships
[1:11:15.2]  I want you remember this is hyphenation, the ocular Asia
[1:11:17.8]  Every Monory
[]			 Peter is trying to identify how many components and system a hive, and it was
[1:11:29.7]  Their relationship isn't so who become the consumer will become to the provider, and it was the pipeline going through, and it was the pipes, So that is a bigger, bigger the divination
[]			 Really, you have to talk about the relationship between those compliment
[1:11:45.8]  So here is talk about the output of the design process as a description off a suffer architectures
[]			 So the whole paid off this saliva well, couple of three things
[1:11:54.2]  When was the input into design was the import of the sign? Is your requirement a specification? I'll put it
[]			 The design Is it silver architecture? And that was the car cover design
[1:12:06.6]  Aces toe
[]			 Identify the components under their relationships
[1:12:11.2]  Calm editors
[]			 So this is the definition
[1:12:18.7]  So where we have this year for requirements design the constructions that Jai Singh on the maintenance where we have ah for the design face, we need to talk about a two kind of designs
[1:12:26.2]  Once covered a hide ever design is really to the architectural able
[]			 How many components do your hive? And then, then was the relationship
[]			 Another is cover the lower level design we talk about, which are both, um, do you use what the structure do? You use it? What's the using your face do you use so those are the feet healthy sign
[1:12:57.6]  Think about it so the design is You can see that we wanted to you, eh? We focus on what offered a systems
[1:13:00.2]  I'm sorry
[]			 The requirement talk about water is in the system
[]			 What did this? Isn't it? Would you but a word designed talking about how does a thing what? We do it
[1:13:12.9]  So here we talk about the detonations, really capture the user
[1:13:18.1]  Need warehouse specification with record a packet of discrimination
[]			 All of those of former user
[]			 Neither will give you money
[1:13:24.1]  So the technical explanation is it come to the same thing
[1:13:30.9]  But I didn't even a long range from even a suspect, so we designed it
[]			 Happy about it
[]			 Identify
[1:13:37.7]  How do we do it? How do you realize that you are your requirements? So is it arrived at a solution that will satisfy both a set of requirements
[]			 Meaning requirements, specification
[1:13:47.6]  Enrique
[1:13:48.0]  Warm definition
[]			 Where do you have this problem? You have requirements
[]			 So this is one problem Where aspect of problem use example off the library
[1:14:00.8]  The library system should be ableto reader
[1:14:03.3]  Even a type of documents you're marrying into a many starving many
[1:14:08.4]  You have even a solutions and you'll have implementation is really went toe my money, my future relationships
[1:14:20.9]  So this whole part of the design we talk about at the time process involves the tradeoffs analysis based on the requirements
[1:14:27.3]  Why is this a case? You could cheat off of that, Mrs, Because sometimes you'll stick a holder, give you a conflict
[]			 A requirement? The piece of his manager asked, For one thing, the customer
[1:14:40.3]  See, I wanted to have a more super leave you with a carny Ride a car right now
[1:14:44.6]  I wanted the car to be a super sleek Lucy Koda
[1:14:48.2]  Durable, uh, a affordable
[1:14:52.2]  But then so you you have another sleeper hold or a saint
[1:14:59.6]  If your parents by your cars it's okay, you can only buy that you cannot wanted to Super sleek, just like the Von usable
[]			 So even the problem stakeholder gave you a conflict of requirements so I could have ah, 50 even requirements what you needed to do
[1:15:09.6]  Beating two per hour high stuff
[1:15:13.4]  You remember your first of actual last week we talked about the requirements of Master Mack
[1:15:16.9]  Right? Must be mad
[1:15:18.3]  Remember, there's a three vehicle result requirements requirements you must become
[]			 That would be nice
[]			 Too high on their summer requirement can leave within the next release the three different kind of requirements
[1:15:31.8]  So you need a poor are highs of them
[]			 So, four for the design, we have three layers of desire
[]			 Okay
[]			 I want you to remember those people today
[1:15:40.5]  Morgan, marry Shawn under Mary shawl and a baby
[]			 The garden
[]			 These are two people
[1:15:52.5]  Is the funding father off the piece of plane off a cell tower? Architecture
[1:16:00.4]  You know about those? Let me see if I'm a part of Havana University
[]			 Oh, this is the She is really there? Yeah
[1:16:18.1]  Is that her? So what does She's This scholar sees it
[1:16:23.6]  Oh, by the way, she, uh, have Obama because she's received this, uh, lesson
[]			 No signs of technology
[1:16:27.5]  Meadows A warning
[]			 Obama
[1:16:31.9]  She's Mary Shaw
[]			 I know
[]			 She's a while
[1:16:36.3]  The funding Father Onder, we have baby garden
[1:16:52.6]  Yeah, So those are true pine years
[1:16:54.3]  Okay, hon
[1:16:54.6]  Years awful cell for architecture
[]			 I believe you Think about it
[1:17:05]  You talk about, uh, already tore into the design, you know, was operating
[1:17:05.7]  They're becoming a I right now
[1:17:07.4]  So who's the first? The guy's a match in the A I
[1:17:14.6]  The new maturing awarded to chew on your award of people is a eyes of deep learning, right? Just got it
[1:17:16.6]  Eso We need to know that still here
[]			 Is that right? You know, So then they're broke
[1:17:55.5]  They have a a seminal book is Carter you 1996 that cover a suffer engineering a silver activator of perspective
[1:18:06.6]  So that's really the first polka mention has introduced the concept of a cell for architecture yourself
[]			 Our desire
[1:18:13.5]  It's not not be systematically if you find her before that
[1:18:18.4]  So maybe find some for our collector in three ways
[1:18:20.1]  One's got a high level design
[1:18:25.7]  Which architecture? Design? So which is a associate of the system? A capabilities identified in her requirements, specifications with the system come home and that you're implemented up
[]			 Okay, so this is the and also another way is a component
[]			 I usually our modules what the component designed
[]			 Your system is really modules
[1:18:49.2]  Andi A the at architecture describes those modules under their interconnections, its harmony, even a connector
[]			 So who is that? A data
[1:19:02.4]  How did they have flow from one potion to the other portion? How the control moving from one port into the potion So how This is the drivers at work
[]			 So those are the contractions
[1:19:06.3]  Interconnections young that we have some kind of lower lie with the sign we should call a code of design
[1:19:13.6]  What do you have a parable? So then as doctor
[]			 So why was it so important? Because it really depends on what kind of ah don't mean you're working with your truth
[1:19:27.2]  Even that Arab you want a true, the most inefficient, Most probably the Arab weapon
[1:19:35.7]  To use a good example, I give you say you I say, Hey, I want to sort out the teepees in our cross right here
[1:19:39.9]  I want to start a cheapie in class
[1:19:42.3]  How many? Starting arrow? Both making use or another word
[]			 How many sorting? I wouldn't do you? No
[1:19:51.0]  How many? Certainly Arab with, you know
[1:19:55.3]  And how many starting our wasn't that I dont suppose we can use it bubbles or so
[1:20:03.0]  Okay, you have bubbles already rising certain disorder
[]			 I quickly sort of more disorder
[]			 You have Ah, yeah
[1:20:10.3]  From the big old location from the most
[1:20:12.7]  Molinari fishing away to some things
[1:20:15.5]  Really? People shoot you quickly
[1:20:18.7]  Sort of murder show the properties is very flossed how he piss or even right? So you know he started okay? Yeah, He was humming you, sir
[1:20:27.8]  Since the bubble shorter
[]			 This is really the lower level
[1:20:32.0]  What doesn't mean that the more friends she wanted? Better So you had just want to start our car
[1:20:39.7]  So this is the TV, eh? Sir? You know, that thing in certain sort of baba son will be sufficient
[1:20:42.1]  Why? The one because of the heat was sword
[]			 So peek there, Right? Arab with some of the best doctor is super important
[]			 And how do you want a piece of the components? Using your face is important
[]			 This belonged to the lower level design
[]			 Where? Oh, even lower than that
[1:21:00.1]  You wanna have a excusable design scene is a case
[1:21:02.5]  You want a choice? The CODIS
[]			 I have the lower level with details
[1:21:06.4]  You want help with the memory of locations you want her dead have for much be the parents
[1:21:11.4]  And it's so well and I really disappearance this either, you know, very worry
[1:21:14.9]  Closed toe Hardaway
[1:21:18.5]  Why was it working with the engine control? Say Sam Talbot, a BMW car one
[]			 We had it
[]			 Not only the code is everything in c cold
[]			 You're so fast
[]			 Okay
[1:21:27.4]  Your father execution
[1:21:34.1]  So the design we have, you know that we have to define this only with the fine vier about you
[1:21:36.9]  How did he find it? How do I located each beat in the machine? So this is one of our lower level
[1:21:45.8]  So you really need to know all of the three levels tohave a good suffer design
[1:21:51.4]  But while we're talking about the architect resign
[]			 We did have a lot of the high level design, so we really focus architect designed part
[1:22:03.3]  So our architecture design is a creative process
[1:22:05.6]  And what we're trying to population the organization of this specified is a function of mount from from requirement
[]			 We keep coming back to our basic concept, You know, it's a functional requirements
[]			 It was non functional requirements
[]			 You still remember that? Okay
[]			 Don't know
[1:22:27.0]  Make amazing this mystic nonfunctional Carmen doesn't mean that there's something
[]			 Okay
[]			 Oh, let me take it about function room
[1:22:32.9]  Prominent doesn't mean that the front specified the function off systems
[1:22:38.4]  It doesn't mean that hoping this is just a very narrow definition
[1:22:47.2]  So on a non functional prominent doesn't mean that something's that decided anything functional or features? It doesn't mean that idea
[]			 So you do not remember that? Go back to review of those
[1:22:57.9]  I would've put three Superstar Medic
[1:23:02.4]  Okay, What is it? Functional requirements
[]			 It wasn't long were important
[1:23:12.6]  Does that mean that a non functional requirements is not as important as a function requirement? Sounds isn't no, Because that nun fund a requirement it We're talking about the corner
[]			 Their interviews
[]			 Okay
[]			 So normally I would have won a long form to requirement
[1:23:34.8]  Sam's cut a college for attribution
[1:23:35.5]  Key ways
[]			 Another car
[]			 What did the interviews? They actually let you mean there's something you probably cannot measure that directly
[1:23:57.5]  We talked about the speed we talking about the usability talking with a functionality
[]			 Talk about the maintain ability
[1:24:09.0]  All off those related or anything with something intended plating
[]			 Your performance usable it
[]			 Hey, now belong to the lung function
[]			 So it doesn't mean that a non functional family is not as important as a functional common
[1:24:26.8]  Because sometimes even lung function requirement is not They're not the magic of the season
[1:24:30.6]  We told you today's I give you this empire over the engine control system
[]			 If you cannot make that a function after every five minutes
[1:24:48.8]  And the whole car? No, the question is either with a functional crime and he really to the Sistine under then young farm girl crime
[]			 Everything because the, um it's another
[1:25:03.3]  Okay, it's not a strictly laid No, but in generations, because off course, you can argue with that
[1:25:08.0]  Users, really? You talk about a usable it hates
[]			 The performance is really from the user perspective
[1:25:15.0]  All right, so there's a really use a party, but that's enough of the whole is part of it
[1:25:32.5]  But as in all the whole part of that, so from user perspective is really again, go by that That very good example is the finally second of functions visit from the user to perspective because it makes it even a function
[1:25:34.2]  How functional reacted with other functions
[1:25:37.5]  So if you president and write it, write about him
[1:25:40.6]  I remember I was sitting in the BMW car is fast cars
[1:25:47.1]  So always steel wire is over there on this bigger right of bottoms on my side
[1:25:49.5]  You have any emergency prices? Is a drive by them, but the whole car does it really testing well, this is really something, my terms
[1:26:01.2]  Sometimes the user requirement is still requiring a functional part
[1:26:17.8]  Yes, sir, it's actually that is the wonderful laundry, for example
[1:26:24.0]  So another common question that does mean that a non functional Carmen doesn't really fit the users, I promise
[1:26:28.2]  So we're talking about using the jays example
[1:26:30.3]  That's a photo department that you just to be able to put out the reporter based on the Cory use it wound
[1:26:39.2]  I wanted to which a quarter's report You Regis secretaries, you agent, in which we are about to see the report
[1:26:43.9]  So, for example, I can pull out a student a grade and even away is right
[1:26:46.9]  I can see even on a beige you know, your year even on your your your your g p a
[]			 But that's the functional requirement
[]			 But enough of programming how fast we can produce this
[1:27:03.7]  How many Celeste would be known for
[]			 That's a beautiful using
[1:27:20.2]  So the organization represents a link between the specification of the design process against here, reinforcing my my door, my joining on the paper, which is the ace
[1:27:33.8]  Another requirement fascination by the rather requirements specification For the design process you carry out your partner with some of the specification activities, so it doesn't mean that you finish your specifications
[1:27:39.9]  But then you started all design you can carousing in parallel just that we have a reason it rotate more incremental
[1:27:48.8]  Open the profits involves identifying a major system component under the our communications
[1:28:05.5]  So this go back to the basic definition office something architecture which is a was your major component on it was their common in cages in the import of AIDS, the requirements of his education and I was the output is a soldier architecture
[1:28:11.0]  Architecture is the emoji goes under
[1:28:13.5]  They are composition
[]			 So we have Well, even you talk about it
[1:28:20.2]  The whole system is about her, See, generally is very important for the harmony
[1:28:24.9]  Even a component of your heart will become a modular conversation
[1:28:28.5]  So the ventilator off What explicit Rick architecture so sometimes system of may not have a good architect
[]			 Sometimes you won't have a good Arky Arky later because stakeholder is a communication which architectural maybe used that as a focus of all for discussion by system, with stakeholders they can talk about
[1:28:48.7]  A single is like a blueprint
[]			 They can have the same page, uh, share the same concept No would have talked about
[1:29:02.3]  And also, it's very good for system analysis is, um, in a way that your analysis on whether the system of commedia is a non functional requirements is really possible
[]			 So they see that it
[1:29:12.2]  Where do we control? How do we increase the speed off reaction? Where's the colder reveal part of it? And also, it's a really good offer
[]			 The largest scale reuse
[]			 This part is a very important on the reuse
[]			 Even you wanted to put your software system on the market
[1:29:30.2]  You know, nobody's ever have this competition between cell phone, right? A summons on a pole, that mortal scum already you have to enjoy
[1:29:43.9]  So out of those you wanna put yourself under Mark Agent
[1:29:47.2]  The cool thing is to use the wilder would approach died, you should be able to reuse your older suffer, but a new feature You don't want to throw things away
[]			 Starting from scratch, I'm gonna be all behind so question to you
[]			 Just as they came from the industry experience
[1:30:06.5]  I you will have a new feet is a production
[]			 Do you want to reuse the older stuff, our system to increase it
[1:30:16.6]  You've all that into a new product or you want to throw things are waiters
[]			 It's starting from Was the bandages off you videos? And it was the risk of awful leave
[]			 I say, Hey, I don't want to be systems
[1:30:37.5]  I want to just about it with and you couple that Nash Massa gpl summer There you Would you still 19 sixties greeting you? Oh, I don't language Ida
[]			 Why? They don't like the way that away
[1:30:43.7]  Si hay si was pretty cool
[]			 I know
[1:30:46.7]  Let me ride a coat for you
[1:31:06.5]  Why don't you do that? Where's the bottom? Um I think if you're starting a system from scratch, it's It's more like you're going back to the drawing board
[1:31:07.6]  And you could reconsider What? What mistakes were any pros? You can go to any pros and cons of had, true from a previous system
[1:31:22.8]  Make a better system you having If you're building off from the same a previous system, you might have bugs transferred to the new system from your sister
[1:31:36.6]  It might be expensive to restart a whole a whole system again sometime
[]			 I mean as well
[]			 Okay, good and put on, sir
[1:31:42.5]  Somebody else have given Alison
[]			 It was the, um was it was it advantages off what? These advantages, right? Is something
[1:31:54.0]  You okay? I'm gonna see what? That Assist them away
[1:31:58.7]  Was it a day? Vintages and he's posted? Yeah
[1:32:14.9]  Look, there's a one thing, okay? I mean, maybe you never thought about that reason to through through the legacies we've got our black asses led away to starting something new
[]			 There's a bigger, bigger, a huge advantage
[1:32:33.6]  That's why most the British kind of calm evolved That because of the risk because of all the same is it runs a pretty much sure
[1:32:35.8]  Very mature, you know, they know
[1:32:37.8]  They know he could section how that works, right? So they know they know what works and what doesn't work
[1:32:45.0]  But you want standing something very new
[1:32:48.1]  You're wanting to risk it for something
[]			 So is for British Petey
[1:32:58.5]  They would evolve their older system into the uses
[]			 Everything well over and the good example is a really nice house
[]			 Never things away
[1:33:11.2]  Hey, that's along with your right, reading your allies to old nobody used at all
[1:33:25.5]  Right now it's just you see, Please So from a sufferer architecture perspective, will the largest scale reuse in survivor important that even they have the pretty final architecture? Okay, you have the three cure architecture
[]			 So back into the middle air, another front, right, Those are good, but they're actually the best reuse the architecture for even uses
[1:33:39.9]  So you don't want revenge
[]			 So the architecture in the system are characteristics we want to understand
[1:33:52.8]  Was the performance off this several picture? Well, that localize
[1:33:58.0]  What's the good? Our architect of the sign you have to be in the Ark Nature
[1:33:59.7]  Why's the invitation in Montana? And I know you've been in deep in the way
[1:34:12.3]  So how do you compare which architecture is good? First of all, you don't have a localized Ivan's critical operation on a medium eyes, a complication
[]			 So for tonight, you probably want to use a larger rather than a fine green component
[]			 So that's him you want to put out a critical component is localized
[1:34:34.1]  So you for those a have a medium on the contract with others So that what does that I mean that you for other come on in the sale, I'll meet him off your back right
[1:34:39.6]  Accessing hi securities deal You want to have Ah, let security is really your concern
[]			 You want to use a layer The architecture with a critical eye Said it in the in earlier
[]			 Which do you know? Any sufferer systems used this approach to increase the security
[]			 So that's your choice off our can
[1:35:01.4]  Architect to design Unique is a very good example
[]			 That's right
[1:35:08.4]  Union has a colonel's on Lee the season people can says that on the outside they have users
[]			 Let me
[1:35:19.9]  You can also get into the or the colonel without her permission and then I can keep it A system see to use a layered architecture s
[1:35:26.5]  So for the safety, you want that localized civilly critic future in a small number off some assistance that it was the only small city has those and then availability
[1:35:44.8]  You wanna rethink re founding a component on the Mecca knees before four of hundreds? Availability is important for you that you used to want to return to the component the air plan uses
[1:35:51.7]  A lot of airplane has outside your door the onboard control say citizen when engine fail
[]			 But you wanna know you have engine p that Oh, that's a very listen
[]			 The father availability
[]			 So even making its ace your concert
[1:36:12.2]  You want to use a fine green? They're replaceable
[]			 So you want company fail? I replaced that I use on your compliment
[1:36:24.7]  Isn't maintenance concerned? Those are some of the concerns of from architecture respectable
[]			 And how do you want to implement it that much? Because of that No, we do have an architect of conflict, which is the, uh, when you use a larger green, a large green component
[]			 You're so, for example, a lot of green component
[1:36:48.2]  You increase the performance, boss, What did you do with a problem you have? You reduce the maintain ability
[1:36:52.0]  Why? This is reduced to making ability because he, for one compliment, fail
[1:36:57.0]  You have to replace a huge view component
[]			 There's another good
[1:37:01.0]  So live a full of account coming around the complex
[1:37:04.6]  You're gonna introduce a rebound of a high improves availability, but you're making a secret is more difficult because of the principle of security that you wanna put it a critical component of very few words
[1:37:24.4]  So after all, if you want a localized city, really, for the futures of usually That means a more communication so that you agreed the performance
[1:37:28.7]  Those are just the thanks
[1:37:29.4]  Comforting part of yourself for design after
[1:37:35.4]  Well, how do we solve died? We wanted to use the eight hat right architect to treat awful amount of season
[]			 For that we can design which one is you really are a major concern
[1:37:44.9]  It's the cities of my major concern
[1:37:47.4]  I mean, 10 abilities of my major concert
[1:37:50.1]  Oh, it is availabilities myself
[]			 What? It's your major concert
[1:37:54.8]  Do you want a proper are high, Seymour? Not as talk about it
[]			 That these are
[1:38:02.7]  How do we, um how do we incriminate any design designs? They are designs
[1:38:15.6]  Really? A problem solving is that he's very table process we're normally have, Is it? It'll achieving your houseman
[]			 So, first of all, we want to identify the core of the problem
[1:38:27.5]  So you talk about anything's you're trying to do you find fun of Ah, uh what have people learned you, Marshal? Earnings are one of those right now, so I'll give you one of her
[]			 What is the design to solve? A
[]			 Um so we'll identify
[1:38:47.0]  Some pipe tends to solve some of the outlying nurses
[]			 So your first? The first being first
[]			 He won't identify
[1:38:54.7]  What is the core problem here? Most the assets of the most important to them or something
[]			 I cannot leave without that
[]			 A court problem, then you these I solution for that
[]			 So after that, you hear? How's the solution? Would you do? Yeah
[1:39:08.9]  How's the solution to you at a meeting of the original requirements? Because the requirement could be very, very long
[]			 Could be like a 50 50 requirements
[1:39:16.9]  Are you Peter? Them recover
[]			 That is the most important one
[]			 And then you have, ah, gradually added to it
[1:39:26.2]  So each iteration in parliament on a high state
[1:39:32.8]  Oh, So each implantation on the heist Ada and then s o then you can he stand it? The core solution isn't outside toe a mop
[1:39:39.5]  Roger
[1:39:41.3]  Yeah, tow a mall
[1:39:41.6]  Broader solution
[1:39:45.5]  So example is a calm Pitre
[1:39:48.2]  First of all, you have combat
[1:39:49.9]  You have no scope, no fireballs
[1:39:50.7]  And those hyper no function
[1:39:55.1]  Is that why you added to it? Have you taken a comforter across? Not like Yeah, that's the one thing off your knowledge
[1:40:05.0]  A hole you should feel sometimes, you know, I said you are competent signs, monster
[1:40:10.2]  You need to know you some cornerstones of your knowledge and opportunities teams the competing theories in It's over a computer
[]			 Architecture was the machine is right
[]			 Andi is the compound you should know so normally
[1:40:29.6]  If you write a compiler, what did you do it? You don't write a gigantic compiler for C plus
[1:40:33.4]  Plus, there's a too complicated
[1:40:39.8]  There's a company in the hell did you come? So what do you do? You started with the compound, Isi
[]			 Hey, I just want to say, can you just give me to identify her? Which is a viable is why I said okay
[1:40:47.1]  You gave me 53 You know, comfort
[1:40:49.3]  I use the prefix once you have that
[]			 Okay
[1:40:54.3]  Can you just handle all on Lian teachers anyway? Happy New Jersey coming out of the scope
[]			 You know, uh, what you write in the program language
[]			 You have a scope
[]			 You understand the concept of school
[1:41:10.4]  You've I d clear accent
[]			 I hear
[]			 And had the clear another
[]			 Obviously, it's a five
[1:41:18.1]  Which ex do I use? The shadow of the sex school
[]			 Right
[]			 So, first of all, I have no viable
[1:41:29.8]  Only my computer, and my baby compiler can only handle numbers now, undeliverable added the scope and even the X and I could just add it, even though it would seems a suburb
[1:41:38.1]  I never go toe average in orange
[1:41:39.9]  You have over the overload e really more feasible anymore
[]			 So they said that my ability design You always want to start by staff, say the same concept we're talking about right here
[1:41:54.9]  So, uh, you to retrieve your husband? Nothing
[1:42:01.5]  Is called it a stable, wisely refinement it which it came was this guy Nikolas A worth? He's a well, with a father off one language, you know? Well, the language
[1:42:17.5]  You know, he's a designer
[1:42:27.3]  Toys or four years
[]			 See? Oh, think a lesson
[1:43:02.7]  Haskell, Huh? Yes
[]			 So Okay
[]			 So what you're talking about
[]			 Yeah, right
[]			 Yeah
[]			 Yeah
[1:43:16.6]  So? Well, you pulled about, right? Uh, yeah, Harold, with Emma, you have the destructor
[1:43:21.5]  Is that together? Is the programs So you wanna have a systematic approach to design based on aligning conquer? You know, the winding conquer
[1:43:29.1]  It would be better company than the first and gladioli dividing this lot of component
[1:43:36.4]  So And also from the human perspective from human Breen
[]			 Okay
[1:43:37.2]  Your psychological perspective we have is a group called a seven plus and minus
[]			 So that means that at any one time, our human mind can leave on the user interface
[]			 We can't handle what we believe
[1:43:54.4]  Seven miners applying to means together even more than that, you just cannot handle it
[]			 So this is you want to be composed
[1:44:05.6]  This is to be until probably seven classes, minus two components together
[1:44:12.2]  It will bring them a too small that become a super Guidi twosome out just like you
[1:44:17.7]  Fire your your computer files your general to many voters
[]			 And you couldn't find where the folder is
[1:44:21.5]  All right, But you are just a tool, Jack
[1:44:22.0]  And you voted us to obey
[1:44:25.2]  So how many folder you should have? About seven minus two
[]			 Also
[1:44:31.4]  Okay, So the problems and when they are more component and then you've omission per component than these, he's not good
[]			 But then too many smaller companies in the another court either become a spaghetti cold in the spaghetti like another was right
[1:44:44.9]  So this is a staple, wise of refinement
[1:44:48.2]  I'm in The last principal is Cory
[1:44:49.9]  Information hiding
[]			 You've always been hiding is the idea is about a thing
[1:44:54.4]  He partners
[1:45:01.2]  Okay, because of this guy, if you had heard about a C plus plants, you've talked about the, uh, opportunity orangey the programming languages
[]			 This is the guy
[]			 These guy
[1:45:07.8]  Now, you suffrage hearing, you know, our land
[1:45:13.0]  There's a bigger institute of scholarships and named after him
[]			 So he proposed this idea called information hiding
[1:45:23.0]  So where you only he's posed with the necessary, um, the information to the external interface
[1:45:29.4]  And then So that is the threatening impact
[]			 Our company in the cohesion
[1:45:33.7]  Which about a central tenet off a bitter orange design
[1:45:37.8]  I want a vacation is a covered in coal
[1:45:38.0]  Huge in later
[1:45:40.5]  Put the nose on your Nope
[]			 Okay
[1:45:42.5]  What is a couple in? And confusion right down for now
[]			 Have you give you example later? You need to know
[1:45:49.8]  And that's the important thing for some activity
[1:45:53.6]  And it remember, holds the baby barn Parness
[]			 Okay
[]			 See the guy
[1:46:05.1]  So behind the concept you've always were hiding under I want you to ornate
[1:46:09.9]  So when we talk about programming languages, it is already torn here
[1:46:18.8]  The programming languages What are the three characteristics? Long which is lost the high never to be Polident
[]			 Oh, but you don't want it
[]			 That language
[]			 What are the three? What are the characteristics? Obstruction
[1:46:34.7]  You heard Henson Polymorphism? Yes
[]			 Very good
[]			 The answer is, if you wanna have open the door along with being called already tore into the long region, you must have a evil measure
[1:46:44.9]  Height? Did you call the abstraction? Right
[1:46:48.9]  You must have any hard hitting
[]			 And the last one you forgot
[]			 Always the heart
[1:46:53.5]  Most of home movies, right? You have finally found in that area
[1:47:01.9]  Several religion is the same thing as you vomit you, Heidi
[]			 Obstruction
[]			 Yeah, so very good
[1:47:11.4]  So it doesn't reek I But what are we talking about here? The Isis off design, Is that it? You're achieving your husband, right? You do
[1:47:21.0]  Ah, find the core first, and then just gradually enlarge it to something better
[1:47:26.5]  When you step wise, that refinement You want to do a brig? A big component of this small component
[1:47:31.4]  You want to conquer the loss of one car, you vomited, you're hiding
[1:47:34.3]  You want that? Do you suppose the mini among evolving into your external component so that you wouldn't do any change, you don't have much impact analysis
[1:47:58.2]  So I'm the producer of the particular concept called a couple in the cohesion, Which are we talking next? Which is a virus Those seasons are structuring is the concern with a encompassing the composing the says them into a the instruction off the server systems because you cannot just write it
[1:48:07.8]  One system, just the bigger band
[]			 You have to do something similar
[1:48:22.3]  Not only this small, the architect to design is nominated Spicer as a block of diagrams of presenting on over you all the same system a structure where you have ah, specifically component that, eh? Sometimes the subsisting shares I accommodate house together that you want to have a date, huh? Control that they have it
[]			 You can have a centralized database on the other side is that you could be example later
[]			 So this is the e go away
[1:48:51.0]  First of all, let's use the packing Robot control systems ready to go toe notoriety
[1:48:51.7]  Go to Amazon
[1:48:53.7]  Howard isn't automatic Another robot going peacock
[]			 There's no human there
[]			 I don't want you reason that the result of the warehouse robot go there people out all by barcode hole there
[1:49:06.6]  Your taquitos
[1:49:08.5]  Okay, you are folks, since it's cold there told the paste
[]			 So first of all, you need to have vision
[1:49:13.8]  System isn't
[]			 Are you gonna have an object? I didn't
[1:49:16.3]  Chicken chase teams
[]			 You have arms control
[1:49:20.3]  You have ah, grape of controllers on a pike in civil action systems on the practice
[]			 A symbol and a fire
[]			 Uh huh
[]			 You have it
[]			 Come, boy
[]			 So over there
[]			 So it's out there
[]			 There's a harmony component off the packing robot are gonna have
[1:49:43.6]  This is a lot of the conquer approach, but later on, you're gonna develop her vision systems operator identification system in the arms control system
[1:49:48.5]  Stone, this is the can see from here, Mr
[1:50:02.7]  So you can call it an architecture architecture over the season, you said you there something we call a box online, my grams and Werber abstract in a way that they do not assure anything That's in the nature
[1:50:09.8]  How there's a component that initiated saves or they turn a readable, probably help these subsidies
[1:50:16.9]  So you don't know that how this is communicated together you have it is a formal languages
[1:50:20.4]  Have Lisa pipe, No architecture
[1:50:25.0]  Uh, even a private reserve
[]			 The producer consumer
[]			 But they never that nice
[1:50:32.0]  There's a box and the arrows to give you a nice communications
[]			 Five grams of forest
[]			 Think holder
[]			 Well, that's a full product of planning
[1:50:51.3]  Oh, so, um, the next in I just hope you go talking about a four are why you succumb to our kids design
[1:50:57.3]  How do you How many styles do we have? Just like a real beauty in your house, right? What? I want to be the arc over the house
[1:51:02.7]  And it was Spanish Arch
[1:51:04.2]  How the Chinese
[1:51:04.7]  Ouch
[1:51:05.3]  Art
[1:51:06.9]  You have this A basilica
[1:51:08.4]  You know, the Catholic Basilica arch
[1:51:11.3]  So you have some unevenness styles
[1:51:15.1]  So how many? How do your Pekar We just style is good of all
[1:51:24.1]  Which kind of assistance? That's with these actors about architectural design decisions so that you're a member of a common up positions that a spin all the design process is
[1:51:40.4]  So where's the long we are talking about? Is there a generic a direction? Architecture that's can be used in? You're starting to your system
[]			 You doing robot? Okay
[1:51:47.9]  We wanna have another robot deliver a sistema people for in the nursing home Jeff had over there
[1:51:57.8]  So you want us to ask yourself, Is there jamerica architecture I can use? Well, we want a system of being the studio data
[1:52:08.8]  So what are our architecture style? Are really a property for these particular application
[1:52:12.5]  So you is a lever application
[1:52:14.1]  Off course you can travel with three here
[]			 We're back in the database
[]			 In the media earlier processes
[1:52:23.6]  You have a At what? We're assisting the big decomposed into modules
[1:52:31.9]  How do you do that? How many multi we're gonna have with a control strategy should be used Article
[]			 I was centralized control
[]			 I'm gonna teach you the control
[1:52:35.7]  You know, teaching you should even a component
[]			 If you are in the architecture
[]			 And how were the earth are architectural? You better
[]			 He's it
[]			 He's our will
[1:52:46.8]  Be violated
[1:53:01.3]  Is there in the corner the attributes? How do I know this arcade design is fast? How about these are our connections of performance? How about of these are architectures improbability with the rest of the systems? The last the way
[1:53:08.5]  How the art architecture being a documented
[1:53:12.4]  So that means that for the new people come here, they know he consorted with the Arctic
[1:53:13.4]  Arkan
[]			 Is it look like we can change that? I love you
[1:53:16.6]  Document your code
[]			 That is how the document you are
[1:53:25.1]  Another thing is the US accurate user season
[1:53:30.1]  He the same domain over have a similar future Better reflected on me
[1:53:33.6]  Even you work with the engine control stays in love for the car
[1:53:35.4]  Pretty watching this
[1:53:36.4]  Similar because the wife Aline, online auction systems
[1:53:46.6]  Pretty much you see the doctor's office for the electronic
[1:53:48.3]  How How's the care? Too much, Phil
[]			 Another concept is that we wanted to have this architectural reuse
[1:54:01.6]  You won't find a similar, says Tim
[]			 I know we can reuse this architecture
[1:54:04.3]  A mono system, for example
[1:54:06.8]  Most rolled out of architect designed
[1:54:13.1]  Probably It's a very similar to what? The okay years ago
[]			 So then? So this is kind of are you using? And you have a cell phone? You haven't even the version of a cell phone yourself iPhone eight
[1:54:27.6]  Have I from I tell you right now, the puzzle
[]			 Have iPhone six
[1:54:30.2]  So how cream you are productive from iPhone six
[1:54:39.8]  So I from seven iPhone age, so you want to reuse a part of those aka nature and that it concept it is called a subpar product line
[1:54:44.1]  I'm gonna give you a little bit a device
[]			 The concept right here was self productive night over a product line
[]			 These concept is talking about it
[1:55:09.8]  He sighed off or I hired a He's that off me, uh, us as the organization See, I put right Alka position instead of high will focus on ichi each individual, uh, product for the cannon, the printer camera, for example
[1:55:35.2]  So we focus on the whole fam nail for products is your family if I'm in love with a part of us So you have a serious all the cell phones was a printer's four cameras
[1:55:50.2]  So for each of abortion we have is we problem in 10 something called a commonality, which is your They share the same common features from thief own words on phones on everyone Muccino only recoverable
[1:55:51.0]  It hit hard
[1:56:02.8]  So you have this sense of a come commonality and of our ability so we can reuse the common feature the common our kids After design these the concept of coastal for a product line you goto I see I website
[1:56:14.3]  Why so sure you're right I c i after engineering used to children have a bigger be okay, Study off the successful
[]			 Yeah, Good
[1:56:17.6]  Mission Control says tips
[1:56:19.9]  Gnocchi are for it was At least you're just excited
[]			 You suffer
[1:56:26.9]  They can put their herd of cattle to the market of foster
[]			 What do you say we go back home unless doesn't want to? The architectural style you are some of the styles said I to a We can't use it to talk about for a very similar abdication domain
[]			 So most the larger say things
[]			 Are he He did
[1:57:00.9]  You're a genius
[1:57:12.1]  Do now that allow for a single our cages because of the earth? Is it love? So for the art architecture attacked our models that we have a we used to a document Archy architecture design in the way that some happens to be having a static structure to show the major component just like a nobody
[1:57:26.5]  Riva sees region system that you have the great controls army controls, even the systems
[1:57:34.2]  And also you have this dynamic processes that the shows the process structure off these system where how this a vision system will part the signal into the central processing
[1:57:46.1]  This is the unending apart
[1:57:49.5]  And also you have the interpret interface model when they find this substance that interface on their relationships
[1:57:55.4]  Motives such as that they'd have a room out of the show, a subway system of relationship
[]			 Not only we have enough along
[]			 We also have control for long in how the controls are moving from one company
[1:58:10.4]  We could also have a distribution model that the show was
[1:58:12.4]  The house obsessing are distributed across even a company
[]			 This is like a cloud computing, right
[1:58:21.4]  Every company was on a cloud, and now we have the comes ethical thing
[1:58:22.2]  Klein declined
[1:58:24.6]  Seen climbing amusing with just the How did your computer We do nothing
[1:58:27.6]  Install software homage
[]			 It's just that criminal and everything I want
[1:58:32.4]  I just success in my computer in the even
[]			 If it is distributed a component
[]			 Now we're gonna get into the deed
[1:58:51.3]  Hell, how many styles off the suffer architecture come to Houston? So this is kind of a system of organizations dials
[1:58:53.9]  Is it really reflect the basic strategy off a two to structure assisting
[1:59:00.9]  There are essentially three basic organization Stiles
[2:00:07.7]  Why did they use them? What's gonna repositories model it causes your mother's it from the name we can tell it is gonna, you know, share the data Re positive the style all the date has in the central place Why even kind of climb Thio consume those data from the central part The website of problems Well that is a good example Another is called a kind of several model which is a shared A service Is the honest the server style Talk about a visit later on next How layered a model Lennix assistance of Auburn see seems that usually layer the model abstraction machine are layer the style off a different design So those are the three design is a styles that we can first about Ace was the repositories model reported story Mother is the the subsystem want Master Yue Chin a date? If I even stayed out a substation wanted Houston data then this is probably can be done in two ways You will see that Um you have you have the yard, your server to toe Save your pictures You have this a server to save your on the files and you have a serious server The process of your customers are required, but probably the all kind of the same data
[2:00:37.1]  So how do you do it? So what is it with you to the shared Vienna is housed in the central database
[2:00:40.2]  A repository, and it can be accessed by orders, even the subsystems
[]			 That's a one way to do it another way
[2:00:50.0]  Is what? Well, each subsystem is the host of their own processing
[2:00:56.8]  So for their own database on depositor is pleasantly tow the other systems, for example, my several handled videos
[2:01:03.5]  I have my only copies for the photos
[]			 I have my own little bit, but I'll fire her own that every if you need it to a farm photo
[2:01:10.3]  The videos of mankind just a sure did have a mom
[2:01:19.9]  So what? Do you have a larger amount of how that will be shared? How's your day, huh? Offshoring
[2:01:20.9]  It's really mostly common use
[]			 You wanna share a huge amount of the So this is example
[]			 Oh, it's a little bit very right
[2:01:33.3]  This is, for example, you have the project depository
[]			 We wanted to design systems
[2:01:39.2]  You have a a design translator
[2:01:41.4]  You have design idea towards the colder generators, prodded a reporter and desire analyzers
[]			 All of those actually use the same artifact in the same the central place in this way
[2:01:59.5]  You know what? I want to use the centralized re positive model so that, you know, we can just accept missing places
[]			 I'm just to share their feet
[2:02:10.0]  What do you think about this? Really? The architecture off that integrated the case tools
[2:02:11.6]  Like what I told you earlier today about the rational sweetie in her price
[2:02:19.0]  Why? You have a clear case of clear quest for the configuration
[]			 The version control
[]			 You have, uh, records the pro for requirements
[2:02:27.2]  And you have a Rosa for architect designed
[]			 All of those actually accept this
[2:02:32.3]  What kinda Seema the project's spaces, then these problems of the better
[]			 Now we talk about it was but the bandages and the others went to jail for this kind of style is not perfect
[]			 And something told it
[2:02:45.2]  Eight slide
[]			 Right
[]			 What can you think of the advantages? That or is that one? Yes, Kevin
[2:03:01.4]  President Present crisis disadvantage would be one system subsystem would update the repositories with long files or if substance are working at the same father same time, and they decided to update the same repositories
[]			 And now over
[]			 Right
[2:03:19.2]  Okay, So you're talking about the recent Alice
[2:03:21.2]  It's the right Reese
[2:03:27.9]  These have been allowed in the programming where you have a tool of instructions
[2:03:31.7]  Want to write it into the single horrible and that we could get to the lead
[2:03:33.6]  It's the result of the wedding
[]			 Yeah
[]			 So Oh, okay
[]			 What you spend on What? He would help you about it
[2:03:43.8]  So if I wanted to say one particular, they'd have see a desire analyzer
[]			 Right? It may be this of Russian controls
[2:03:49.8]  For example, I'm the one the chain of mighty have fallen
[2:03:53.6]  That means a everybody else was the have achieved this because of work
[]			 I mean it
[]			 You will
[2:04:01.1]  You want to change everything here within the hour, complying with the same kind of the uniform and the schematic
[]			 You with your wife
[2:04:07.2]  You don't have so much of the local lies The autonomous afraid, the court of things that you know each individual components
[]			 You don't have to manage
[2:04:18.1]  No cool thing about titties
[2:04:20.4]  Compresses bottom
[]			 Thank you
[2:04:26.6]  So the manages that river deficient it is She are larger
[2:04:29.3]  Mom Beta on the substantive letting need not concern, but with the how did has been processed
[2:04:34.3]  Centralized? No, the bank have secured his own off those, and you don't have to worry about
[2:04:44.4]  So unless you want to share the models, that is a publisher
[2:04:45.2]  As the reporters problems died here, the subsidy must agree on the positive data model
[2:04:52.4]  You must agree on the same scheme I use
[]			 You cannot use it
[2:04:55.5]  Anything else? There's a revolution is a very difficult and expensive
[2:05:00.2]  Why is the more you spend Sable? Because everybody went for anyone? Change in our labors
[]			 Have a photo with you
[]			 What are you? There's no scope of a specific A management policy, so it's a very difficult, very efficient There's a problem
[]			 Now let's talk about the second
[]			 The model
[2:05:18.8]  This is the kind of so remote
[2:05:20.3]  This is a typical fall
[2:05:27.7]  The website You have server anyhow climbed
[2:05:35.1]  So this is the ship with the system out of which shows how they die in the process, it is distributed across a random components that a you have something is stand alone
[2:05:42.6]  Component is a server that provided service that you be concealed it and then you have a set of crying over it because on the service's network allow this climbing
[2:05:54.0]  Except this is really kind of several
[2:06:00.8]  There's an exception for base is something we call a P to P
[]			 You know, Petey
[]			 Oh, Petey, you're to appear computing right appear to have become a media
[2:06:16.0]  There's no specific component as an exclusivity being server on
[]			 There's no critical component that is closer to being us
[2:06:25.9]  Ciro sometimes come declined on the kind of obvious
[]			 That's right
[2:06:28.8]  Example off
[]			 This isn't any of those there
[2:06:37.5]  You like the map
[2:06:39.6]  Stir the torrent into those things
[2:06:45.0]  You get it, then the lady is a star war movie on the Internet
[2:06:51.8]  We don't do that where you don't know that the movie you to buy a pizza on your computer
[]			 And meanwhile, your computer become a server
[]			 People get your that they'd have from your So because See, I you know, you can see two lines
[]			 Well, I you don't know that it from somebody else
[]			 You know, I get all the data from people
[2:07:09.0]  Sources were all over the planet
[2:07:11.6]  The meanwhile, your copy to become a silver people
[2:07:14.9]  Donald become appeared here
[2:07:17.2]  Horan and Alistair, you know you're wounded, sharing united regards that
[]			 There's no your definition
[2:07:26.4]  Who is this service? So this is the really the Internet over the united you have
[]			 Ah, cut it off A server
[2:07:36.4]  You have video server health
[]			 Even if you was keeping a server
[]			 A Web server
[]			 This is via barcode example off climbing several
[]			 So what's the advantage of these one of these? Hi
[2:07:57.1]  The defendant is a watch
[2:08:12.4]  So because of your architect had architect, I'm gonna be signing using particular style for your assistant
[2:08:22.1]  You need to tell your clients I need to be responsible
[2:08:29.2]  How do you manage it? Why do I pick up these are I was a vintage over these
[2:08:45.3]  Any analysis servers are rigged in four different service that, uh, lord can be divided
[2:08:54.1]  The lower cabinet divided
[2:09:01.3]  Let's very concerned so divided that all my load right to even a service on the beaches over only dedicated to one particular service
[]			 Right? So if I had my video service is so really done by pictures of my files, everything we'll keep
[]			 Okay, That's it? Yeah
[]			 The one pages
[]			 What was that? This
[]			 Oh, it was it was it
[2:09:24.7]  These other manages Joel by heaven
[2:09:38.3]  So you need to have a lot of so the other one ages that the advantages that we can teach you with a straight forward of a a month, even a service
[]			 That's exactly right
[]			 You know, like a what do you talk about that
[]			 And they're so smart, efficient, and make use of the night work
[]			 Each making a very easy toe, Ida, and remove the silver from it on
[2:09:56.8]  Operating service is another thesis
[2:10:00.8]  Eventually, that this No, she guarded Amal Durso
[2:10:03.2]  Subsidies are yousa UNA data organization on a date are in a channel
[2:10:10.2]  Could be different because you haven't even a sobering, don't know center line
[2:10:17.8]  You could have a rebound in her management in each of the Venice over on dhe
[2:10:20.4]  Also, you have a no essential or register off names and service, isn't it? It may be hard to find out what a service this is
[]			 Just like that, he's out of money
[2:10:39.4]  This talk about the lost uh, So where are Cato Model color layer, Also called abstract a machine
[2:10:48.7]  This is a useful tool for the interface off subsistence, well organized system into a set of what layers we should hear
[]			 You should probably are only talking to
[2:10:59.2]  You're a Jensen to their neighbors
[2:11:02.4]  And this is supporter, eh, Incremental
[2:11:03.8]  The vertical mentor off
[]			 This is subsisting on you
[]			 Just have my just another one later
[]			 You want either one there? I only needed worry about in my just in the later Don't worry
[]			 So I'm gonna just in there is affected
[2:11:17.3]  So however, sometimes those the layers are very artificial is where your heart ought to say
[]			 A writer for this particular service is which layers
[2:11:28.5]  So I put them toe Oh, hominy leaders have is a very were artificial, for example, will be like basis
[2:11:40.0]  So we talk about the a version management has said the Persian Khan toes where you do have, ah configuration management system in there
[]			 Do you have this object management system in there? You have that? The database, the system
[2:11:56.6]  Earlier you have offering asses over insistence that there are based object on a conflagration
[2:12:05.1]  So let it isn't pretty clear, but I sometimes you I want to do particular Tosca is hard to know
[2:12:09.6]  Neither do I belong to this object of mine image management in there
[]			 Although I belong to the day that basis system
[2:12:15.2]  There is hard it'll identified, which there isn't really belong to this kind of look
[2:12:22.4]  Where are artificial? No, wait
[]			 So the advantages
[2:12:26.7]  Four days, a support of incremental development policy
[2:12:31.8]  Seems so one dayers developed some of the service provider about later, maybe maybe made available to the other users
[2:12:38.9]  It doesn't affect anything you have
[]			 It's not a nothing
[2:12:44.6]  Is this the whole season? Oxygen is a changeable and a portable, so as long as they use in, your face is unchanged
[]			 So the layer can be replaced by another criminal layer
[]			 Right
[2:12:59.3]  So if I say the open, she steams object intimately
[2:13:00.3]  It needed to be upgraded
[2:13:03.5]  If I just make him my user interface A patron Hope on the bottom
[]			 I just change that immediately
[2:13:07.7]  Doesn't make it is so wonderful
[2:13:13.0]  And s o if even a new universe changes on a new facility
[]			 I added a layer on Lee
[2:13:17.8]  The Jensen the mayor is affected
[2:13:29.4]  And the later seasons localized machine dependencies, You eun earlier make it easier to provide a multiple planet forms in Parliament, for example
[]			 Right here
[]			 So see here this is hard is the over insistence
[2:13:40.6]  If you're working with saying I system, I post a seaman was the window system
[2:13:43.4]  You're only the chin today, so they are only all the rights that you don't have to
[]			 You see the light of any jail for visa
[]			 Okay, so that's a beautiful, very, very nice Arky Arky
[2:14:00.0]  So the defense of peace, the other one had just severity
[]			 People structure So front example, you will have a file management
[2:14:06.3]  I unify management, Johnny all the earth
[]			 So how do I know what you are? Another problem is performance
[]			 It can be a problem
[2:14:18.4]  So the multiple levels off communicating interpretation may be required
[2:14:33.3]  So, for example, if I really want a problem to the princess, teams have the golden rather than a physical automated Onda Also service's request from probably hear me how to really interpretative several times, all the way to go to the bottom of the year
[2:14:37.5]  You cannot just acquired it
[]			 The communication may have what you come in
[2:14:42.8]  They get drunk with me than they are
[2:14:44.4]  Rather than use the service provided by a jest there's a would be speaking something not as efficient as you like the centralized That s it is what this one I can't directly
[2:14:58.5]  Which earlier? Out? One of how I think you have a pen
[]			 You treat you so this is just this style
[]			 Okay
[2:15:08.3]  To summarize on the D Zion lecture we talk about it are three things
[2:15:15.3]  One is, uh, Pamela
[2:15:19.1]  To design each achieve your huntsman
[2:15:26.3]  You want to know whether the A's we talked with a stepwise of refinement, increment or leader? A braking system into a a seven plus and minus to a component
[2:15:42.6]  And now you wanna have with this information hiding where you have these, he's posing as a meaning moment
[2:15:43.9]  Postal or the outside
[]			 The using of your usage
[2:15:51.1]  So you wanted to be obstruction machines
[]			 You wanted the hive
[2:15:54.7]  D'oh
[2:15:58.9]  How did the concept called a coupling cohesion
[2:16:04.7]  So then we talk about a three Arkin interests
[2:16:05.3]  Bios is which is that you have, ah, reported three
[2:16:10.2]  So you have this re positively model
[2:16:11.6]  Christ, they're a model on, uh, the layer model
[]			 So you have all these model you need to know
[]			 That was the advantages and a visa
[2:16:32.0]  You want to know that you would your particular abdication, which you told you? Is it fighter to use widget particular architectures style
[]			 There's something
[2:16:40.4]  Okay, so this is really the summary off the ark now
[2:16:48.7]  I want to cover that the company, man Cohesion
[2:16:57.2]  Um oh, it's a season four herein you have a 20? Okay
[2:17:05.1]  Let me just quickly talk about a city on the giant college calling the attributes
[]			 You might have a little bit of lecture life after we pick up a phone
[2:17:21.6]  So we So now we know that the architectural design iose we talk about it, the design principles
[2:17:28.9]  The next question is, how do you define the colder? They attribute all their design
[]			 So we know the cause of the attributes over software over and you'll be fast
[2:17:35.5]  Suffering will be reliable suffer
[2:17:41.5]  I needed to be a Parker free unfolded Holleran DS and exception handily all over those
[2:17:46.0]  This is called a tribute for supper
[2:17:49.2]  How do you evaluate recorded he off Archy for these, the actually this fall fight
[]			 So one is a first of all a larger systems in to be divided into smaller modules
[2:18:10.2]  Other questions to the Asia
[]			 What ace? A module
[2:18:23.9]  How do you define a module so mold you? You know the definition is a free savage nation
[2:18:26.6]  One is you must Leslie
[2:18:30.9]  A lesson like a sickly camping grease was a lexical
[2:18:35.8]  How was something called Mexico? Analysis, right
[2:18:54.8]  Seen pecker tax analysis on the Mexican Douglas Semantic
[]			 Before any program Languages in the house
[]			 There's a tool part
[]			 Any program, languages
[]			 How did he find a problem? Language
[]			 Another only program
[]			 Languages, even English
[]			 You know, whatever Spanish
[2:19:17.9]  Any language include the program languages
[]			 You have a two way to a tow us back
[2:19:35.6]  To define that language is what's gonna syntax And how does he find a climber? So for English, for example, How do you speak of sentences? Um, you must have a subject you must have worked
[]			 You must have had on the subject
[]			 Okay? Obviously, I say yeah, okay
[]			 That's a grandma
[]			 But you never want to see you
[]			 I see
[]			 Yeah, I know
[2:20:01.9]  Play, I This is wrong
[2:20:04.2]  Everybody's gonna laugh at you
[2:20:05.9]  Looks like a data
[2:20:08.9]  No, to the fore program
[]			 Language
[]			 It is same thing
[2:20:11.6]  Program languages like a C plus a java
[]			 Any those the program languages
[]			 We have a grandma too
[2:20:17.7]  And that a prudent for digger grammar grammar we use to define our programming language He's got a contact
[2:20:25.2]  Frequent Hamas requirement for programming languages
[]			 So the same thing, just like we are doing English
[]			 Okay
[2:20:43.4]  You want to speak proper English? Have to assassinate a world with subject
[2:20:45.0]  I plead so but simple program languages even
[]			 I see that
[]			 Okay
[2:20:51.1]  Or expression
[]			 You must have a A
[2:20:55.7]  First of all, I'd be flying
[2:20:57.5]  See? How did he find a bar? Um, the identify ours
[]			 Identify
[2:21:03.0]  Are you, um, gone longer term? Is that a horrible you called a viable right
[2:21:07.4]  But the program along with your prospective warn second term identify it
[2:21:14.2]  You'll see that you're variables can not to start with it
[2:21:20.7]  A number your mom's has started with a light her on the follow any companies and polite
[2:21:24.5]  How did he find that agreement? So I would say, Hey, did you find the identify? Where are you? See, I mustn't define my my number
[2:21:34.4]  Egypt is what? You're a one
[]			 That right? Right
[2:21:43.5]  And then But the fire my identify resting you to use a letters I wanna have What? Um yes
[]			 See? Oh, fireable kind of function
[2:22:02.9]  The one you can all say one function how, besides he's you know what else do I need? I need the user lighters
[2:22:05.9]  Writer is what with the aim With the house? No, with those already
[]			 This is my polka
[]			 He's in my office
[2:22:28.5]  This is like a English alphabet
[]			 But this is my language is a bit well
[2:22:38.0]  How do I know I can you find my identify it? Did you see? All bearable was there? How would this have obeyed my basic of a couple of reasons? How did you find my identify WR under the the rule Cider
[2:22:47.7]  Your mother started with a lighter
[]			 I see
[]			 So I must with a lighter
[2:22:57.4]  Well, Toto, I don't hear, but you must start with one
[2:23:03.6]  Do I see Blossom Union? These that has a one on that one
[2:23:19.6]  And then what do you do? You can have any number off with DDT or like her Finished
[2:23:22.1]  Dad, you have any combinations, right? Yeah
[2:23:29.1]  What does raise me and transiting into? You must start with the one Let her off that light her so many
[2:23:36.5]  And then you can peek a Geeta Plaza
[]			 Light her
[2:23:39.3]  Oh, did you? The teacher didn't let her like a letter Or teach the latter teeth that a cheetah that it doesn't matter
[2:23:45.6]  This is a mike Grammar
[2:23:47.4]  Carcano is frequent
[2:23:53.1]  So anyway, on another ice pack off a program languages the color of semantics
[2:23:54.3]  Many could tell you the meaning off
[]			 What does it mean when you're writing something? Well, this is anyone
[]			 This is long
[]			 No
[2:24:09.4]  When they come back to the what? How do you find the molecules? Marches and said Mexico hunting with being led from the meeting perspective, I want to put it a things that just elect to each other, joining in the code
[]			 They must get coming
[2:24:26.5]  You have one colder he of uncle here they are not the one mortal and immortal separated by something else
[]			 But they must be coming together
[2:24:31.4]  The second element called a boundary
[2:24:32.8]  An image
[2:24:37.9]  You must help begin on the India or even use any off the Cymbalta
[2:24:42.8]  Your long would you define or use the beginning India
[2:24:46.4]  And that's sort of when you must act with 80
[2:24:47.9]  A aggregated I
[2:24:51.4]  Any fire which gave it a name for the entire month? A name
[2:24:58.5]  So I mean, this in module called it a friend module
[2:25:02.7]  This is module called a, uh, robot arm control module
[]			 this is called a region multi
[2:25:14.0]  Okay, Those air distance to the definition of these according to today's definition, any pre she's procedures, the functions, the object of my third
[]			 They're all part of these models
[]			 So these are we talking about? The call it he over the design
[]			 Sometimes you couldn't design something for few
[]			 Your job for few your functionality
[]			 But I may not be a good design from example if I wanted to design a cheap right
[]			 You have this register here
[]			 See you
[2:25:50.3]  I want your keys, I and save you
[]			 Oh, the city
[2:25:54.8]  He'll have a whole bumper registers
[2:25:56.1]  Seaview has a whole lot of air use
[2:25:59.2]  And how well the shooters
[]			 So I don't know
[2:26:03.4]  I see that you're only allowed to use vinegar and gate or get an organ
[]			 Okay? And what would you do? You gotta come out with the sign designs
[]			 Why is that? I use a one cheaper for register
[]			 Another cheap for air
[2:26:20.2]  You and I'm a cheap 34 shooter
[]			 So the hell three chips
[]			 It's a one design
[2:26:29.7]  But you see that because you'll allow me to use it on get in or get nor gate
[]			 I can use it the other way
[]			 You're wrong
[]			 He's never
[]			 What I bring is the whole system into three even chips
[2:26:38.5]  What I do, I've been divided by the gates
[2:26:42.2]  So what has all the engages in it? We'll have the order, our casing, that I have more cases
[2:26:47.7]  This is a bigger mess
[2:26:53.7]  How do you utilize the air, you functionality? How to utilize the shifter function, I think, is a very hard so you can see the lot of communication among those gates
[]			 This is not very good at these, So this is just so your a simple example coming according designed appear have called the modules over there
[]			 Right
[]			 This is good
[]			 A design
[]			 This is not so
[]			 This is really a green matter
[]			 Our this is to these eyes function tonight after their quality created it
[2:27:28.3]  But the second of design, because I composed all the data together, compose all the end, get an organ or get it together is a very hard to understand
[]			 And it's a very hard all
[2:27:35.9]  I locate the fault where the problem is Is the shooter has problem was the air
[2:27:47.3]  You have a problem you don't know, and it's a very difficult to east end on your hyung state for something else
[2:27:54.0]  And I also cannot be re using any product you re use listening in some product
[]			 Can I use it? But I can use that because I'm gonna take the air you out a night
[2:28:04.2]  Contrition, using even the air
[]			 You are even register
[]			 I use a fast mantra mantra
[]			 Foster register
[2:28:10.6]  I don't use that averages, or you can take that out
[]			 So this is much more
[]			 Modular is easy tow
[]			 You use it to replace
[2:28:20.7]  So modular mask
[2:28:21.2]  Medusa must be like the first design, which you want to have
[]			 A two important concept
[]			 What is that? A called a maximum relationship
[]			 We think the modules Meaning we see my module I wanna have
[2:28:36.4]  With all the close relationship that is impossible
[2:28:39.0]  I know you wanna minimize our tradition ship between its molecules
[]			 It's like these within the region
[]			 Starting probably have
[2:28:49.5]  We're closer relationship between gates, but a peach in his models has a very, very simple That's your design principle
[]			 And that is a good architecture
[2:29:00.0]  And this is green Apple to the next
[2:29:01.9]  The big becomes evident
[2:29:06.6]  Caught a couple and I think, uh, Caracara
[2:29:08.4]  We're gonna probably stop right here
[2:29:09.9]  We repeat, how about a couple of oxygen and we will talk about it
[]			 Modular techniques
[2:29:17.2]  And so we can finish niece of the suffering
[2:29:21.6]  What? I gotta put it first half of next lecture
[]			 Okay, Thank you very much
[2:29:29.4]  And keep you are the canvases I would opposed pie the package
[]			 Right
[2:29:36.2]  And please a sign up on Europe groups before next week
[2:29:53.5]  And also, I'm gonna invite you through the up where the software licenses, because for that, into your and do your homework once
[]			 Oh, yes
[]			 Yeah, you said that
[]			 Okay, how's it go? You come to see your own comes already
[]			 What you want? Yes
[2:34:02.0]  Which one motor One
