# Problem Definition [5pts]
## Picard paper
The picard paper dove deep into what are emotions and how they can be expressed. Form this it was segued into how to detect
emotions from direct word translation, to visual facial queues, and even body language. Picard talked about how it can be 
extremely difficult to accurately detect emotions since not everyone has the same behaviors of emotions. There are even some 
non visual queues such has elevated heart hreat or blood pressure. On top of that when trying to study the behaviors 
of emotions on page XX [@picard95] talks about how even in lab experiments people might behave 
differently than in a non simulated environments. 

After the problem of detecting human emotion there is computer decision making. Picard talks about how good decisions have 
a factor of emotion involved. Too little emotion and too much emotion can be detrimental to the decision making process. 
Thus Picard states that computer need to have emotion in order to have a better decision making process.

Interestingly near the last paragraph of summary Picard states that computer with too little emotion will not likely 
"attain creative and intelligent behavior" but too much emotion the computer might "eliminate" us humans. 

Based on detecting emotions then inputting actions to observe the emotions on seeking a goal of a specific emotions

# Challenges and Limitations [15pts]
## Picard paper
In general the Picard paper is very theoretical and doesnt dive into real experiments that hte author has completed.

# Proposed Approach [25pts] 
## Picard paper
### Collecting the data
First thought is there could be a study to collect the data. HAve people sign up, maybe read some papers, express emotion 
and video record all of this. could be good, but might be a "lab environment" so the data might not be soo good
### Youtube/twitch for a source of data
Now that we have a Ton of video of people out there it might interesting to collect lots of videos and try to train models 
to detect the emotion. Twitch can be used for entertainment so I think that the people will have some maybe over eccentric
emotions. 
### Training with Movies
There are a ton of movies out there can we could use to train models.
### Blended models
Take some of the training data to build hte models and cross pollinate the data so that we build a blended model.
It would be interesting to see how well the model preforms for the specific model

# Validation Methodology [10pts]
## Picard paper
In general leave a subset of collected data to use to test the models 
### Individual models
From the proposed approach we had a few different ways to collect the sources. run the models on each test set. Also cross
run the models on the other tests sets. For example Run the Twitch model on the movie model and vise versa to see how that goes
### Blended models
